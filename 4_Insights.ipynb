By removing varying instances of ___horror___ and ___scary___ from the lexicon file, I was hoping to give higher weight to words like ___good___, even if the comments mentioned what VADER terms as negative words.  To properly do an analysis, I would rather create a different lexicon version of VADER, tailored to the horror genre in general, to give higher weights to words like ___scary___, ___horror___, and whatnot.  \n",

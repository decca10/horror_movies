as for tropes we have family trying to survive the apocalypse with movies like a quiet place bird box and it comes at night

then theres the wholesome thing turns out to be an evil cult trope with movies like midsommar the vvitch sort of the ritual apostle the shrine the babysitter get out red state hereditary would you rather  the void green room the sacrament etc

the posessionexorcism movie tropes in the conjuring movies and all their spinoffs insidious 1 and 2 the last exorcism the rite the possession the devil inside ouija the devils candy great underrated movie btw exorcismus paranormal activity 1 and 2 possession of michael king possession of hannah grace the exorcism of emily rose the taking of deborah logan veronica grace hereditary again i could go on

1.0,com,"id say that a common cliche nowadays is the fear of the unknown and how almost no popular company nowadays is taking advantage of it

ill only be talking about shitty movies but still obligatory spoiler warning

example 1 absolutely everything is explained just before it happens

 in the byebye man the mediumpsychic girl explains to the main character that the byebye man can cause auditory and visual hallucinations in order to try and get yourself killedgt not a minute later she sees someone about to get hit by a train and jumps onto the tracks killing herlt instead of having a 5 minute exposition dump just showing her have the hallucination can clue the audience into figuring it out we arent 3 year olds with no thought process movie

example 2 the villains get 30 mins of exposition dumping

this is the worst cheap mistake any story could do for example in most bad modern horror movies everything gets a huge exposition dump if you want the audience to fear your villain dont tell us their strengths and weakesses first thing in fact it would be 100 times better if you just dont show us at all junji ito and his works which arent garbage are the most ridiculous yet terrifying thing ex huge balloons shaped like your head with a noose attached at the end that try to kill you yes he made a comic about that and it was great all because you dont know where they came from and dont know their intentions

she then sees a girl soaked in blood moving inside her house from camera but couldnt see in real she saw blood too on the walls in the house from camera but it was not there in real one day the rapist somehow entered her apartment and stabbed her while she was at bath but she manages to save herself by probably killing him but with all those blood she ran everywhere in the house to escape and realized the girl soaked in blood she saw from cameras earlier was herself

i think horror isnt dying as much as it is evolving but im not sure its an evolution im 100 on board with either     
i do tend to see more and more horror movies being advertised nowadays as well as more public interest and acceptance from my experience loving horror used to be considered sort of a weird or oddball trait but now it seems to be in fashion    

obviously this yields positives and negatives because on one hand a lot of really talented indie horror directors are breaking through to the mainstream in a big way and releasing some amazing movies ex jordan peele and ari aster on the other every time i log onto netflix and see a new horror flick added i groan internally     

there seems to be an influx of plots rooted in very boring psychologicalparanormal concepts and most of them end up feeling very palatable and fake deep to me  almost watereddown i feel like people put too much pressure on horror to be intellectual as of late and it truly does lose its impact if i can watch a horror movie and never think about it again then it clearly hasnt done its job nexttonone of these movies are franchiseable and i really doubt any of them rebootworthy ten years from now

i missed the family part in ops post definitely definitely not recommending then ",0,1003,186
1.0,com,"im against the concept of banning films usually but i make an exception with that film 
the best review i read about it said you think you want to see this movie but you really dont and i really wish i had taken their advice 

while it does horrify which technically would make it a horror movie it seems to push boundaries with sexual assault to a point that seems extremely unnecessary there was one shot in the whole movie that i would even consider art and it was the scene with the checkered floor ive blocked most of the film out of my brain at this point everything else felt like gratuitous shock value it gave me ptsd for a few days weeks if im being honest and i can usually handle graphic sexual assault scenes

you say you dont scare easily either but the question is rather if this has always been the case

saying that you dont watch anything less than 5 is very fishy strategy essentially this has been my strategy too and it causes me some distress at times because i might miss out on some great movies the strategy i have adopted is to follow the reviews of some established players that have voted on past movies the way i have so if the average of a movie is 3but dude has voted 8 then there is a good chance i would too",1,871,175

i only watched this movie for the first time recently i was under the impression it was some sort of slapstick comedy involving spiders i was pleasantly surprised this was a real blast it felt like it was trying to combine the tones of gremlins and jaws and it succeeded quite admirably theres some true terror and suspense here and first time director frank marshall does a good job with the buildup letting us get to know the town and characters before all hell breaks loose the film has strong production values with spielberg and kathleen kennedy  producing and frank marshall who produced several classics with them and was a 2nd unit director on films like raiders of the lost ark back to the future and who framed roger rabbit we have spielbergs normal editor michael kahn working on the film great cinematography by mikael salomon the abyss and a great score by trevor jones cliffhanger the last of the mohicans labyrinth and animatronic effects by chris walas gremlins the fly  jeff daniels is also a great everyman lead and he has great support from john goodman and julian sands this is basically a b movie with an a list budget and crew how many horror movies especially creature features today would take the time and money to go and film a 15 minute prologue in venezuela complete with sweeping helicopter shots this movie has kind of been lost in the shuffle when it comes to films in the amblin catalog of the time and it did ok but not great business when it came out but id say this deserves to be just as fondly remembered as those other films there are have been talks of a remake of arachnophobia but id say it wont be as good especially since they no doubt will use cgi spiders instead of the mix of real and animatronic ones this movie used and there is no doubt it wont look as good

fun facts

the spider on the poster was removed from the vhs and dvd covers for some reason they put it back on the blu ray covers

the trailers and tv spots marketed the movie more as a wacky comedy featuring john goodmans character heavily even though he actually has an extended cameo they also used the term thrillomedy to describe it something that hasnt really been used again

when jeff daniels came on board to play dr ross jennings the film was a serious horror movie one that daniels told philadelphias daily news was pretty formulaic you could tell that the lines were kind of written by computer he said he and frank marshall were hoping for a more ironic tone so the script went through several revisions and the filmmakers studied alfred hitchcock films and jaws 1975 to get the tone right one key change daniels character was given a fear of spiders",1,2675,485

0.0,com,"love this movie it might actually be about as close to a favorite movie as i could claim to have without really having one i didnt like the overall original story as much but it did have kind of this echoey spookiness in its whole tone that i loved and was sorely missing from the film and it needed to add in a few of the scenes from the story as well especially one in particular the story doesnt deal in limbos it tells you they went to hell the first time and were granted some sort of pass in striking a deal the opportunity to live again if they could take out jim for whatever reason so the scene is that jim is ready to cut the shit he knows they are who they look like he can guess what they want so he holds one of them after class for a few minutes and they feel each other out and talk fighting terms jim asks him already kind of seeming to guess but testing his reaction where were  you you know before the kid tightens up and actually looks scared and goes hey we aint talkin about that then as hes leaving jim tells him point blank that hes gonna kill him when they meet again the kid kinda looks back and goes thought you knew daddio im already dead 

the overall tone this scene and a couple of other minor tweaks the movie wouldve been nearly perfect 

oh also in the story it leads you to think it means as it does mean in the movie that sometimes just the dead come back only at the end of the story after hes made his deal and been presently compensated he thinks he hears footsteps behind him that sound more like hooves and he wonders to himself if he truly made the right decision if sometimes our problems arent doomed to come back in one form or another no matter what",1,1694,333

when it came to this game though i was so immersed that it almost felt like i was the one walking around union peeking on corners trying not to be seen by monsters so i could stab them in the back realizing theyre not dead and yeeting myself out of there while being heard by other enemies swearing in every language that came to mind until eventually losing them with only a chunk of life left

caught this last night thought it was quite unique definitely not for everyone as most of it is slow uneventful and after its first 25 funny and relatable minutes it is very vague i liked this about it though and im typically a person who looks for nearcomplete clarity in books and movies i love love love the way they used sound in this 

there were one or two scenes that genuinely scared me which is definitely a plus i feel like this is one of those films that youll either love or hate the runtime is only 80 minutes so i say its worth a shot

0.0,com,"ive talked  about it in other posts but ill be making an actual review at some point ive been busy so that full post might not come for awhile but heres the unfinished version

i thought it was fucking amazing firstly the decision to dump the saekis story in order to tell a new one that has similar themes was much needed as the original plot has been explored from every possible angle imo secondly i love how unapologetically brutal origins is as it sets it apart from others in the series that prefer to have their violence off screen i also appreciate the return of the weird time warp shit from juon the grudge the only things i dont really like about the show are the whole based on a true story thing that bit about the face being twisted in fear they stole from ring and the lack of the usual opening text other then that i have some smaller issues like the pacing not always being perfect especially between episodes and some of the subtitles feeling a tiny bit clunky in some spots 

final verdict

solid 810 this is on par with the original films for sure im super glad i got into the series right before origins was announced

i didnt need to explain myself to someone who just assumed i was being some run of the mill indiana trump supporter that thinks covid is a scam you have no idea how much conversation has been had about if i should go or not between my friends my parents and my doctor 

this was something my therapist and i thought of as a way for me to get out of an antisocial behavior rut while being in my comfort zone and surrounded by things i enjoy everyone is experiencing this pandemic differently some of our lives have been affected drastically and some very little i was off work for two months and ive been back for two months i was terrified to return to work and am still pretty scared being there i have been checking online seeing how the event is handling covid safety but wasnt sure still am not but most likely wont go how the events usually go i just wanted to ask a few things to anyone who knew on this sub so i could have all information needed before i made my decision

0.0,com,"how is supporting an institution while being safe controversial  i dont think it is  people who are totally dismissive of the best way to view a movie and who seem to want it to go away is what is controversial

i totally reject both the idea of a movie premiering at home and then theaters or at the same time because its ankling theaters  in fact i think the home window should be lengthened to six months plus like it was years ago  if theaters hopefully just in the short term are showing fewer movies in fewer auditoriums theyll hopefully have to lengthen the time they have them to allow people to trickle in so the home window has to be extended

you should check your local regular indoor theaters to find out if any are open and showing classic movies  cinemark was going to open last week and show a bunch of classics im not sure if thats still the plan when they do  out of the five times i went recently three were old movies including superman 1978 which i had never viewed in a theater  it was great  the empire strikes back is showing at a single screen theater starting yesterday",1,1095,204

i absolutely agree about the direction of the film being inconsistent but the character development wasnt needed it just would have added to the drama and taken even more away from the horror aspect i think thats because as you mentioned  the horror aspect of this film couldnt handle the weight of the actual subject alzheimers amp its destructive traumatic legacy it bordered a drama more than a horror

originally years ago scream 5 was supposed to be a direct follow up to its predecessor  jill would survive with part of the story centered around her trial and how justice wasnt exactly being served with differing accounts of what happened her playing up posttraumatic stress and the insanity plea  kirby would survive into this film alongside judy hicks it was highly speculated but never confirmed that judy would be a ghostface here  little details known aside from this

a few years ago scream 5 was being pitched as a new jumping on point  i dont know that they planned to bring anyone from the earlier films back  the idea was that there would be a reality show based off of the stab films where of course things go wrong the idea got canned but not before the idea of making it more meta came up switching it to be set in the real world about the scream series instead of stab meaning all actors could return

as of now neither of the above are the central plot of scream 5  the only major plot detail is that after moving away from her hometown a girl returns after her parents are murdered  many believe this is kirby  some have theorized that it is a previously unmentioned child of gale and dewey  since parents are murdered either dewey could be dead or a stepdad could be  it sounds like in any case they want another run of scream movies and plan to intentionally leave this one on a cliffhanger of some sort",0,1464,270

1.0,subst,"so i just finished watching doctor sleep and at the end abra asks dan if theirs more and dan says the world is a dark and hungry place maybe theres more like here or maybe theres something else something worse i think the something worse is pennywise  

so pennywise is a demon essentially  technically he is an inter dimensional being consisting of pure light energy he feeds on the essence that people have some people have way more than others do they shin

it stands to reason that abra will grow up focusing her abilities to the point where she is extremely powerful she will probably dedicate her life to seeking out others who shine to guide them not unlike a jedi she will probably also angered by her father and dans death look for those who twist their abilities for unnatural evil purposes the members of the losers club also shine so it stands to reason that at some point abra and the losers will meet up


 abra now a badass shine warrior will also be destroying evil hunted sites like the overlook hotel so i see a cross over movie where abra defeats for real pennywise in an epic movie where dan also comes back as a force ghost pardon the cross franchise reference  i think the losers club and abra will ultimately challenge the dark king of the dark tower 

the king of the dark tower is stealing shine essence from kids to power a weapon to break through the barrier where it originated from and if abra can kill it then she definitely gets on his radar  

reasons why i think it will happen eventually  

one hollywood is out of ideas and this is a semi original idea 

two abra is young and female and black so she is the type of hero hollywood would be totally into and base a trilogy on

third you can bring back the actors who played the losers and dan so great ensemble cast


four its all steven kings books so no cross company bs 

five it actually makes sense for once and would feel like the natural progression of these characters 


six it actually all in the same universe anyway so no portals to other realms or vibing to alternate earths

1.0,subst," 
ever seen a movie which genuinely gives you a headache and you feel like why does it exist dont get 
me wrong many sorts of movies do give the vibe of why do they even need to exist be it from a story 
point of view or anything but in this particular instance this movie was like nothing literally nothing 
the run time from 155 minutes could be shortened to about 15 minutes heck this should have been a 
youtube video and even then it wouldnt have been good 
i dont even care about spoilers here 3 friends one vlogger go to la and yes the sad excuse for using 
the so called found footage style of filming is that the vlogger needs to keep her camera on at all times 
just so that she doesnt miss anything worth recording there is no setup a sad excuse of a story and 
everything happens in the last 20 minutes of the filming now come to think of it if the movie consisted 
of them boarding the flight and then cutting to the end 20 minutes would have been ok if at least for 
not wasting my time
could have been salvageable if the cutting room had decided to take out all the unnecessary stuff and 
released this in the form of a web viral video and funnily enough this was the route they were 
superficially trying to portray with the opening and ending so called creepy dark text
dont watch it please its not the worst found footage horror out there but i guess we do not need to 
waste anyones time with this piece of work

2nd movie starting scene two boys in old fashioned clothing they hear pleas or murmuring maybe chanting one boy want to go look the other kinda wants to leave but has no chive but to follow his idiot friend they come to a cave temple some people are chained maybe the one guy is chained cant quite remember anyway the idiot friend gets closer to the guy  all the people dressed in black the guy looks at him as if to thank him i think the idiot boy set him loose then the guy proceeds to grab the boys face and stick his fingers in his mouth and rip his jaw apart

the setting was winter in a forest i believe there was only one cabin involved

the first and technically last kill was a girl in a pink jacket getting caught in a bear trap

the final girl made it to an ice rink but no one listened as she was being killed

1.0,subst,"so firstly i have seen most of the original japanese film but dont really remember the details that well so im not sure how much this particular part of the story differs between the two i also cant remember if this is explained in the original and they just decided not to put it in the remake also i am quite stupid so this is probably more me not understanding rather than a problem with the film 

my issue is with two pieces of info and how they fit together the first piece of info is that the morgans live on some small  island off the mainland the second piece of info is that samara is buried in a well that has since had a cabin built over it on the mainland now from what i do remember that cabin site is not on the island i may be wrong but this is why im confused

because in the scene that samaras mother yeets her down the well why are samara and her mother even there they are presumably miles from their home without the father with them or at least he isnt seen there are also no cabins in this flashback scene so you couldnt say that theyre on holiday together in the cabins maybe theyre on a walk but why come all this way for a walk when they live on a fairly nice island and why not specify that in the film at all 

also samara is watching horses in a distant field i know the connection here is that her mother loves horses but why are they in this scene in particular those cant be the morgans horses because theyre miles from their stable i dont remember it ever being said that they have a second stable on the mainland or that they travel around helping other stables and i doubt the mother is so connected to her horses that all of them must be taken with her everywhere she goes  i just dont see why the horses were included here except from to make that obvious link for no reason 

can anyone explain why samara was thrown down this well while they were miles from their home for seemingly no reason at all besides the fact theres a well there maybe this is explained in the film and i missed it because i was being a coward and watching through my fingers maybe its explained in the original and the directors just decided to be lazy with the remake maybe im an idiot and cant put it together either way please explain someone this is bothering me like hell",0,2290,444

okay so i grew up watching horror films since i was little like around five years old horror films was a family thing and they were scary at that time but now these days theyre not that scary nor creepy everything i written below is how i feel and probably missed a lot of details but everyone has their thoughts right ive seen hundreds of horror films so i want to point out some things i think

despite not being scared to recent horror films or since after 2013 some films were scary the films terrifying scares etc died down i did watch it and it chapter two which i think were done amazing despite a lot of fans think about it the designs were beautiful and right down creepy as you would expect from a stephan king film remake despite a lot of remake fails like the nightmare on elm street which was more a horror and went off from the original yes i said more horror but if you know the originals there was also comedy so it ruined the remake the  it designs and story reminded me of how creepy horror films should be like the mist movie yes i know its a monster film but i consider it a special place among the horrors just like crimson peak all these films are not my all time favorite but theyre beautifuly done how i look at it is that horror should be more carefully done now and what we need is a new original story movie series like the original friday the 13th the remake was really good i find  nightmare on elm street and halloween but that doesnt stop there because 13th ghosts was an amazing movie there is a lot of horror films that deserve more like dead silence which in my opinion damn now that horror film was creepy as it shows a lot and tells the story perfectly besides a killer doll like chucky im not hating the childs play movie because i did enjoy them myself  that film was the right way and damn good all these films yet now in this age i feel like im talking old even though being 23 the horror genre movies seem dying down which i dont like we need a new series and a new story so that the horror can be revived with something new imagine stephan king guillermo del toro james wan and scott derrickson come together to create a new horror universe there is a lot of horror films i love that i did not mentioned like mama haunting in connecticut not 2 amytiville horror 1408 gothika 30 days of night sequal sucks texas chainsaw massacre while the most disturbing movie i seen is hands down sinister which out of all horror movies ive seen that one was creepy disturbing scary and psychological creepy  yes i know there is different horror genres but its still good i find to point out that horror films are dying down the most interesting and could become the most terrifying horror film could come from the thoughts of the original nightmare on elm street because dreams can do so much between mentally and physical which can be psychological terrifying like sinister in my opinion we need a horror that strikes us all in a way if we have a horror that makes us disturbed like sinister and the frightning of dreams like the nightmare on elm street together would be beautiful in a way but it has to be brought together and create its own horror series a new born terror that we horror lovers need and to revive the genre with a new continuing series then again we all have different fears but that can change because we all have dreams which is common

the second one is about a guy who sneaks into a cult like looking for his sister i think and they worship an old creepy dead witch underground who drinks blood and controls the crops and theres like a lot of tunnels involved and symbols and in the end the whole town burns down and the main guy leaves on a boat i also think it was on netflix at one point",1,674,139

1.0,subst,"so to start this i dont really know if this is the correct community but i just wanted to write about it truth or dare came out in 2017 and you may have heard ofseen the more popular but worse truth or dare that came out in 2018 check out truth or dare 2017 on netflix to get full context but im gonna give an overview here and yes theres obviously gonna be spoilers 

to start were introduced to 5 characters and we meet 3 others later first is tyler the med school student and the boyfriend of alex the smart girl and these two are just some lovebirds how adorable also in their car is maddy alexs best friend the scene then transitions to luke the athlete driving with his girlfriend jessie who is meeting the group luke says theyre meeting his friend group in a haunted house that voyeuristic carter rented out for a halloween fun time all 5 friends arrive at the house to find carter chilling on the front steps recording them and making sex jokes with another car arriving carrying comic relief holt and mean girl addison they all settle into this house where carter explains that 30 years ago 7 teens played truth or dare and all but 1 died in the house and the group like fucking dipshits decides to play truth or dare the game starts off normal until maddy picks up a truth card saying did you sleep with tyler and she had to admit the truth tyler and alex both get pissed and storm off as well as maddy until tyler comes back to yell at carter when tyler picks up a card that says put your hand on the hot stove tyler doesnt thinking its just a stupid card carter wrote when a force pulls his hand to the stove his hand gets burned and flesh tears off tyler is let go eventually the group comes to help him and holt and luke confront carter about what the hell is going on when the tv explains the games rules three rounds 48 hours dont do the dare or lie on a truth suffer the consequences the group takes their turns getting dares such as jessie having to eat tylers burnt flesh and holt having to grab exposed electrical wires hes saved until addison gets a truth card during her mental breakdown that says are you an addict and this is shown to be true from some foreshadowing earlier where we watch addison pop some pills she lies through the whole thing leaves and then gets impaled on a sharp pipe killing her swiftly the group head back to their college campus where we see carter chilling in his room looking at memories of addison when his camera starts moving on its own he moves it to his bed where he sees a carrielike addison writing in blood for carter to hang himself for 2 minutes as his dare carter doesnt and screams for help until its too late and he gets hung by the demon possessing the game just as tyler holt maddy and alex get there alex does research on the game to find the survivor and ask her for advice and the survivor tells her that the group needs to share the dares to survive and also that the game must finish at the house the scene ends and goes to luke and jessie sitting in lukes room when luke gets his dare for round 2 saying he must rob a gas station and giving luke a complimentary gun luke and jessie head to a gas station luke pulls out his gun but while hes looking at jessie the cashier pulls out a shotgun luke tries to grab something to complete the dare and gets shot in the stomach in the process jessie starts frantically driving calls alex and alex explains what she heard from the survivor and they all meet at the house where they started playing they go inside where tyler gets the next dare which is to drink a goblet of poison but the group outsmarts the game by drinking soda splitting the poison and puking all the poison back up and they survived the next was to pull out two teeth which again the group easily accomplishes everything goes to hell when they get tasked to play russian roulette alex shoots herself with blanks twice and maddy goes to shoot herself when tyler takes the gun and turns it on himself and gets a bullet in the head and tyler dies holt goes to the bathroom to cool off when he gets his dare saying he has to get run over by a car holt runs back down to the group to explain that he was involved in a hit and run and that he needs to get run over jessie gets in her car to run him over but her car wont start and maddy doesnt get tylers keys until holt is getting run over by the demon controlling the car and holt dies alex explains that the game plays off of fear obsessions and secrets such as holt getting run over or jessies next dare which involves her having to get chained to a pipe which she refuses because there are roaches and jessie is incredibly scared of roaches jessie dies when an army of roaches swarms her and eat her alive round 3 starts with just alex and maddy left when they both get assigned to take off 7 living body parts in an incredibly gruesome scene we watch these girls take off fingernails toenails toes fingers earlobes and even a whole foot when alex gets in her car to start driving to the hospital to get her and maddys body parts sewn back on when the gps configures to say kill her which to the audience is implied to be maddy but throughout the movie an inference can be made that alex is pregnant and it must be because if maddy had died in russian roulette like she was supposed to alex couldnt kill her so the game is talking about alexs unborn daughter alex loses it and heads straight for a tree when the scene cuts to black and youre supposed to think they both died but nope they both breathed at the end thank you netflix subtitles and the movie ends roll credits

now that was just your context now time for how everyone could have lived starting off in round 1 if addison had just admitted she was an addict she would have lived carters next dare involved hanging himself and logically since the house had locked shut when the game started and only unlocked when addison died carter would get that dare when he was still surrounded by his friends so carter could have hung for 2 minutes and then be resuscitated by med school student tyler and lived luke would have survived by going with his friends since in this universe they would have all been stuck in the house and when he went to rob the gas station have his friends go behind the counter so the cashier doesnt try anything now theyre all back in the house when they have to get teeth pulled and play russian roulette and here someone must die playing legitimately alex would have shot then maddy then tyler and then jessie since that was the order they got their dares in in the first round so jessie would have died either way holt was smart originally by trying to get his foot run over but the car wouldnt start he went to check the engine to fix it got his hand caught and dragged down the street and ultimately run over but in this universe only jessie would be dead this also means that carter and addison would have still had their cars so 3 other cars are in play besides jessies thus holt would have survived by getting his foot run over also in this universe since jessie is dead before she got her roach dare that dare wouldnt exist so they would move to round 3 once holt got his foot run over round 3 only had two dares and i cant go adding dares to something so ill just continue the 7 body parts everyone donates a body part and what the dare specified was whole body parts not different body parts so since 7 people are alive everyone could have given up 1 fingernail or toenail as a least painful option finally alexs dare about having to kill her unborn baby she just repeats what she did in the original version since she didnt die she just got injured 

and that ladies and gentlemen is how almost everyone could have survived truth or dare 2017 go check out this movie on netflix it is really good",1,7823,1493

1.0,subst,"i quite often find myself puzzled by people who choose to waste their money and time to watch a scary movie or more importantly why do people spend their time producing such garbage i can see how romantic movies even if they are bad could function as feel good movies and therefore make a profit

i filter out all movies rated 03 out of 10and i get scary movies and romantic manure i see how and why the romcom stuff makes sense but im truly puzzled by the scary movie stuff

so i figured maybe i am just missing something and that something could be that i have been just desensitize to horrorscary stuff by consuming uncanny amount of videogames and tv 

im 30y old now i started playing videogames when i was 4y old and as a kid i could watch whatever i wanted from tv even the late late stuff

that means i remember watching masterpieces like 1997 cube that stuff kept me up that night and i rememer i was scared stiff watching it there were so many good horror movies that kept me up for days 

movies that rely on building fake tention and scares have never really been my thing i have been to movies with my buddys where i just have to walk out to keep my cool after witnessing a 1minute tention build to get a scare resolution that is just a gdm rat

i remember playing doom3 for the first time and i found that game horrifying i had to take serious breaks just to keep going now i can finish the whole game in just hours without breaking a sweat i remember playing silent hill series close to that time and it was not a big struggle mentally but then i talked to other people who also played both and they found doom3 ez and silent hill hard it really puzzled me essentially the more i was exposed to scary stuff the easier it was to digest and my reviews on content were highly affected by the order in which i consumed them

quite recently i watched a quiet place i struggled to see what other people saw it was not horrifying nor scarybut just a neat idea infact i found myself boored several times looking for a remote to skip ahead just to realise im watching it on the big screen i was just thinking i wish i had seen that when i was a kid that would have been awsome maybe 

this made me wonder how many people actually just grow out of getting scared easily because of this i remember loving some really shit movies at the time that i would absolutely hate today

so does that just mean that some grownups never grow out of bad scary movies",1,2457,471

0.0,subst,"hello fellow arg enthusiasts

as the title plainly states i am currently writing a story in fact multiple stories i believe would be great for an interactive alternate reality game ive been a fan of watching args for years but never attempted to make one before but am also very interested in seeing what me and a group of likeminded people could conjure up

unfortunately i cant outright state what the story is going to be about for obvious reasons but for anyone interested i would be happy to discuss it through dms what i can say about one of the stories is it will involve the use of breaking codes but not for the sake of edginess or creep factors but rather out of necessity for the protagonist to communicate with the outside word without being detected by something unable to break codes this is something i can elaborate on further in the dms for both of my stories i am hoping to use some visual effects to further enhance the realism something i myself have no experience creating but have some great ideas in mind for what these effects might look like i do want to be able to make accommodations for these effects as well so any feedback on the difficulty of what im asking for would be much appreciated

first and foremost this is supposed to be a collaborative effort i need people willing to have regularly scheduled chats with myself to help craft the story into a reality and i do not really want to necessarily be the protagonist or the leader in this effort either im just a writer with an idea and that idea cant become a reality without other peoples input and hard work along with me so i want this project to become just as much yours as it is mine

secondly as i stated before i am a writer not a filmmaker though i am capable nor a video editor nor a visual effects specialist i am a musician and do have some great connections to make some cool sound effects but thats about as much as i can help in that regard i do however have experience writing short stories research papers and investigative journalism so my attention to detail within the crafting of a compelling story is quite good if i were to toot my own horn so id imagine my main role within creating this arg would be the basic story and working out a more detailed timeline of events for a set of characters

so now that ive gotten all of that out of the way i would like to list off the thingspeople i am looking for and what their roles within this potential arg might be

 cgi amp visual effects someone who is capable of making things appear on screen that can fool the untrained and to a certain extend trained eye as well into believing what they are seeing on screen is real even if they know it isnt the best webseries and args know when to leave it up to your imagination and when to show something onscreen for the greatest dramatic effect i want this series to be able to both show and tell its story these stories might also involve the use of codes so creating codes within certain visual effects may be a necessity as well
 video editor although i have a basic familiarity with video editing i am painfully aware my ideas for great editing exceed my own abilities in the field that is why i am looking for someone who has a flair for knowing when to cut and when to linger on a shot someone who is capable of creating great visual transitions between scenes and an over all better understanding of their editing software than myself i am a writer and have no interest in learning how to do cool editing tricks but i do enjoy writing stories that necessitate good editing skills and want to work with some great editors to put their skills to good use
 social media gurus i know this sounds like a kinda weird role but the job essentially entails knowing how to create websites a traceable breadcrumb trail of clues scattered throughout social media platforms as well as stimulating user interaction within the story
 actors i am capable of acting though i wouldnt dare call myself an actor i do have a bit of a higher voice which is good for certain roles but a detriment over all i also look quite young for my age which to me lowers the realism of the stories i want to tell so i am looking for people with some decent acting chops that know how to go beyond the basic acting tricks you learn like the thousand yard stare and can deliver how real people talk with imperfections yet a genuine talent for the right inflections i am also looking for people who have a deeper voice along with a more older looking complexion for the antagonist and mysterious character roles other nationalities besides americanenglish are also welcome but the main language of this series must be in english although other languages could be used in an interesting way but cannot be the main spoken language within the series one of these stories does not actually require the real voice of the protagonist so some acting does involve nonverbal communication
 writers room  game makers group anybody from any of the previous roles that is interested in helping flesh out the story with myself this would involve taking the concepts and ideas we have and turning them into specific episodic story beats writing scripts for the episodes and consistent discussions about the whens and wheres to reveal information as well as how said information is going to be revealed i dont want to be the only one in charge of the creation of this story in my eyes collaborative efforts always yield the best fruit so i want to work with other writers on how to expand and further enhance my story ideas as well as input their own ideas into this story i can see my ideas having a lot of potential for many different people to put their own unique spin on and thats exactly what i want to encourage

hey you made it to the end congratulations if you are a person who has any of the talents listed above andor are interested in hearing more please feel free to upvote this comment your talents and dm me with your skills questions or general intrigue and i will try and get back to you at my earliest convenience i might ask you to share some of your previous work to get a grasp on your skills but understand this comes with the exchange of getting to know more about the stories ive written thank you for taking the time to read this and i hope to hear from some of you soon",1,6348,1173

im posting this here because its a parody of horror movies if this isnt the right place then ill find somewhere else anyways imma try to recollect my thoughts

dont get me wrong some parts were funny shorty is hilarious as always every scene with the dude with the crooked hand were the best imo and the cat fight scene was great that being said the lows definitely outnumber the highs it had much more truly disgusting scenes than the original and all of them involved sex in one way or another it got stale and repetitive after the dream sequence

the first movie also had a nasty sex scene but there was only 1 so you didnt know what to expect from it and thus the surprise was much more effective than the dozens of sex scenes in this one

dunno i definitely didnt like it it was an overload of repulsive events that werent exactly funny curious to hear what you all have to say",1,1235,235

0.0,subst,"it has the perfect mix of originality social commentary comedy and horror each of the tales addresses and social issue and all have a unique twist clarence williams deserved an award for this movie his utterance of the shit is quite possibly one of the best lines in horror movie history

i wont spoil the story but ill a give a description of each one

the film begins with some drug dealers picking up drugs from a mortician  clarence williams but instead of giving the drugs he tells em stories of several bodies in the mortuary

tale 1 involves a bunch of racist cops and new black cops first day on the job

tale 2 involves a teacher trying to help a young black boy who comes to school everyday with bruises when asked who did it he simply replies the monster  this tale is quite possible one of my favorite horror movie segments of all time

tale 3 follows the story of a racist who is running for governor who has just purchased a property of a slave owner  good story but imo the weakest of all the tales

tale 4 follows a violent gangbanger who is offered to be released if he takes part in a reformation experiment  the ending to this one is really deep

theres also a very good wrap around story i wont ruin 

this movie is really good and original and would suggest if you like unique horror films to check it out",1,1326,249

 the consequences of gaslighting your girlfriend

jesus fucking christ i havent seen a movie go for broke on the whole asshole boyfriend trope since white settlershttpsvocalmediahorrorreedalexandershorrorreviewofthebloodlands2014 2014 at least that asshole showed some growth this prick doubled down at every moment of the movie he goes from gaslighting his girlfriend dani played by florence pugh to stringing along their relationship rather than dumping her to using danis sisters suicide as a weapon to being completely unsupportive as a boyfriend to stealing a thesis from someone who is supposed to be a friend to eyefucking ever woman in sight the list goes on and fucking on god how hard do you have to drive home the guy being an asshole

i complain about this tons of my reviews writing contemptible characters as the protagonists isnt a deal breaker but it sort of sets a poor tone for the movie we cant empathy with the struggles of the protagonist if were constantly rooting for them to get killed im all for the catharsis of watching some asshole get his comeuppance but if there was any way to empathize with him at all the statement would be far more powerful

that being said after the first 10 damn minutes of the movie youre just hoping something bad will happen to this prick and his obnoxious hetero boyfriend the only one you end up feeling remotely sorry for is josh played by william jackson harper he was just trying to write a fucking thesis and while he can be a bit of an asshole too its just because hes driven that and the asshole male lead constantly pushes him

however this movie has a lot going for it outside of the contemptible characters that cinematography is just spellbinding and almost contrary to what typically makes great horror cinematography this movie is bright colorful and has an amazing sense of melancholy while everything is just slightly off and even a little sinister its always just north of creepy and even inviting

i dont know who wrote the story for this but its almost like an adventure in cult anthropology the detail and mythos that goes into this cult and their behaviors are so damn developed its flat out fascinating i made a similar comment about this style of writing in my review of black mountain sidehttpsvocalmediahorrorreedalexandershorrorreviewofblackmountainside2014 2014 this level of plot development might be a bit too smart for most horror fans its kinda good that the rest of the plot is dumb simple or it could make the plot muddy

i was worried that this movie was going to be just another take on the wicker man 1973 and 2006 however other than the basic premise this movie is nothing like wicker man wicker man just didnt put this level of detail into the setting and it was more of a faux murder mystery than an anthropological investigation into a cult

i do recommend midsommar even if just for how fascinating the plot is its not a must watch it might not even make it on to my all time top horror list but its pretty good for horror heads and general adult audiences alike

 spoilers

im not even sure if its a spoiler to say these characters were selected by the cult as a sacrifice that was pretty much how the whole movie was billed and most went into it expecting the wicker man 1973 at best and the wicker man 2006 at worst notthebeeshttpstwittercomhashtagnotthebees

but again the devils in the details of this movie and the cult the cult was just targeting the three men dani gets dragged in almost completely by accident because her boyfriend bluffed and invited her along expecting her to say no this just showcases one of many circumstances where the male lead is a contemptible prick he didnt want her to go was fully intending on cheating on her while he was away he only invited her because she recently suffered the loss of her sister and he didnt want to look like he was abandoning her when that was fully what he was intending on doing his lack of emotional support just sucks dani in because shes in a vulnerable state so she decides to join him

i mean can you get any more calloused the womans sister just killed herself and her parents in part because this guy was constantly driving a wedge between them and it never occurs to him to maybe stick around or that shed want to stay with him because she needs the support through this part of her life

so can anyone guess how the movie ends if you guessed the asshole boyfriend dies you have a firm grasp on why the asshole boyfriend is even a trope but they dont just make dani some final girl hell no she gets crowned may queen and joins the cult as their leader literally selecting her asshole boyfriend as the final sacrifice thatll fucking teach the prick

anyway totally worth a watch

0.0,subst,"and i say american because if youve ever watched a japanese horror movie they dont seem to rely too much on cgi and jump scares  its mostly buildup suspense and psychological by the time a ghost shows up you are thoroughly freaked out and the ghost doesnt jump out or make a scary face  it just walks across the hall or is peeking at you from around a corner

american horror from the 60s and 70s were like that  the exorcist hardly had any jump scares at all  the famous psycho scene is a perfect example of real horror   someone slowly walking into a bathroom while you are showering  the classic movies focused heavily on the characters and their mental torment and the audience felt it with them

today most horror is almost entirely cgi andor relies on jump scares and an over abundance of loud noises  for example  grave encounters  what started as a solid found footage horror flick with great atmosphere and buildup quickly dissolved into standard trope and cliche demon faces  even implied some sort of devil worship

but is that what works for audiences today  every now and then a gem like hereditary comes out which was a great horror movie  but most of the time its crap like the marilyn manson nun from conjuring and people think thats scary  will american horror ever go back to character atmosphere and suspense",1,1327,235

0.0,subst,"long post

the theme of alice being someone noone really knows is brought up time and time again 

first of all her mother doesnt know her which is actually made explicitly clear but then neither does her boyfriend her friends father or brother in fact her best friend says something to the effect of maybe we all knew a different ally    

this continues in her death her family tries to uncover what happened but they dont really succeed think about it what dont we know 

 1 how she died we are never told and its never explained how she died she was swimming in a lake where the water was completely still theres no mention of any investigation over her death it actually struck me straight away youd usually expect some suspicion some lines of inquiry but theres nothing that seems so crucial but its just never addressed

2 what the nature of the relationship between alice and her neighbors was yet again this investigation dries up and then were just supposed to accept that its all done and no longer a concern

3 why was she seeing apparitions of her death and not just her she literally filmed the apparition and its confirmed to be her its just baffling how downplayed this is in the movie they literally have footage of a girls own ghost taken at the time she was still alive we get back to back shots of her corpse and this photo and its evidently her but apparently no one really cares   theres even more in the story which is left somewhat ambiguous like why she really buried her jewelry but fundamentally we dont actually know anything about her either we arent told anything specific about her personality other than the fact she liked to keep secrets everything that is said about her is just stuff that people observed before her death and its very general like she was well liked   

right at the end of the movie we have a scene which i think emphasizes this very much and also makes a point of the fact alice is still not resting and in fact she is just being forgotten about yet again her mysteries continuing june goes back for one more meeting with ray in this scene we have alices meeting spliced in between   

it is heavily implied that in her meeting alice was seeing the future as she apparently has the power to do alice says someone is coming to her door june says shes going towards alices door ray tells june to go inside and she does reluctantly alice says her mother has come into the room ray asks alice what her mother is saying she says shes not saying anything she doesnt know im here ray asks june whats in the room she says nothing alice says her mother is leaving june wakes up and looks at ray   

straight after this scene we have the family leaving the house and putting the past and alice behind them they say the house feels calm that they can be a family again and just generally imply theyre moving on we even see her brother and mother sitting on the bench in their garden laughing the same one alices ghost appears on in the photo after this we have a series of photos showing that alice was watching them the entire time but noone noticed these in the videos or pictures   

the only things anyone noticed were forgeries her brother at the lake not her other people in the footage but they never noticed her no one knows this girl seemingly she was well liked and loved supposedly and yet noone knows a damn thing about her and noone seems to care all that much sure her family are upset overall and get angrysad when they find the footage of her fucking the neighbors they wonder about why its there but not really they dont try to look for the truth they just want to satisfy their own sense of moving past it   

the father does this straight away with work and alice literally confronts him as a ghost to try to get him to look into it more which somewhat catalyses the story but then it still ends unsatisfying  noone ever seems to look for the truth in this movie everything connected with alice is completely unsolved and yet everyone just moves on like it has been solved sure we find out some more information about her but we still dont really know who she is or what happened to her we just know a bit more about the events leading up to her death  

its heavily implied by the ending of the movie that alice still isnt at rest and that shes actually just been forgotten or the family have moved on without her part of that is moving from the house which also gives the impression she will just remain in the house waiting for someone to actually solve her death   now look i think this could be just bad writing or it not being fully formulated before it was finished i dont know but there really is so much ambiguity about her death and we never find out anything about it we find out she kept secrets had sex with her neighbor buried some stuff and saw visions of her own death what does that actually tell us about her death  

nothing and yet the film ends and the family move on seems to me the whole point of the movie was alice trying to figure out whyhow she was going to die and prevent it burying her stuff going to the medium etc and then dying anyway then she tries to haunt her family so theyll find out but they ignore her and move on  

also i noticed it seems like theres a somewhat abandoned or just extremely vague implication that her brother murdered her hes the last one to be with her in the water where she died he mysteriously gets bruises all over himself at one point and this is never explained was she attacking him for what hed done he doctors the footage for his family which is clearly something he plans as he starts getting more into photography right after her death whatever the reason is for this or why he would want to be able to do it or to convince his family they were being haunted he also doesnt see the real haunting that is occurring in the photos  

think about what you actually watched and it just feels kind of empty to me way more questions are posed than that are answered and yet were supposed to accept that everything is finished in the families eyes yet clearly its not from the ending   even the movie seems selfaware that the mystery is still yet to be solved alice remaining in the house and yet the family move on as if it is if anything this movie just gives the horrible message that if you die under extremely mysterious circumstances no one not even your own family will care enough to try and figure it out before running away from where it all happened the real horror for me is the idea that as individuals we may never be truly known by others while were alive even if were wellliked after our deaths people may realize they never truly knew us but the living are so caught up with moving forward in life that they cant be bothered to care 

i think a lot of the movie is about being alone and unknown in life and in death",0,6856,1284

im posting this here because its a parody of horror movies if this isnt the right place then ill find somewhere else anyways imma try to recollect my thoughts

dont get me wrong some parts were funny shorty is hilarious as always every scene with the dude with the crooked hand were the best imo and the cat fight scene was great that being said the lows definitely outnumber the highs it had much more truly disgusting scenes than the original and all of them involved sex in one way or another it got stale and repetitive after the dream sequence

the first movie also had a nasty sex scene but there was only 1 so you didnt know what to expect from it and thus the surprise was much more effective than the dozens of sex scenes in this one

dunno i definitely didnt like it it was an overload of repulsive events that werent exactly funny curious to hear what you all have to say",1,1235,235

this had a bit of a slow start and some unlikable characters but i grew to really enjoy it by the end and have always been disappointed that it didnt get a chance to finish the story i still think its worth watching though especially now that we may not get much in the way of new tv shows or movies for a while

0.0,subst,"this afternoon i saw peninsula in theaters and it was pretty disappointing i found the movie to be uninteresting and uninspired i didnt care about any of the characters and there were too many characters the zombies never felt like a threat but more like an obstacle the action was never interesting and also sometimes hard to follow there were too many overly emotional korean drama moments i found the movie to be extremely predictable except when continuity errors changed the outcome of a scene and there was only one memorable scene for me 

overall i give the movie a 410 my friend gave it a 610 and said she was being generous i wouldnt suggest going out of your way to see it for reference i give train to busan a 610 world war z 410 dawn of the dead 2004 710",0,767,143

0.0,subst,"and i say american because if youve ever watched a japanese horror movie they dont seem to rely too much on cgi and jump scares  its mostly buildup suspense and psychological by the time a ghost shows up you are thoroughly freaked out and the ghost doesnt jump out or make a scary face  it just walks across the hall or is peeking at you from around a corner

american horror from the 60s and 70s were like that  the exorcist hardly had any jump scares at all  the famous psycho scene is a perfect example of real horror   someone slowly walking into a bathroom while you are showering  the classic movies focused heavily on the characters and their mental torment and the audience felt it with them

today most horror is almost entirely cgi andor relies on jump scares and an over abundance of loud noises  for example  grave encounters  what started as a solid found footage horror flick with great atmosphere and buildup quickly dissolved into standard trope and cliche demon faces  even implied some sort of devil worship

but is that what works for audiences today  every now and then a gem like hereditary comes out which was a great horror movie  but most of the time its crap like the marilyn manson nun from conjuring and people think thats scary  will american horror ever go back to character atmosphere and suspense",1,1327,235

0.0,subst,"long post

the theme of alice being someone noone really knows is brought up time and time again 

first of all her mother doesnt know her which is actually made explicitly clear but then neither does her boyfriend her friends father or brother in fact her best friend says something to the effect of maybe we all knew a different ally    

this continues in her death her family tries to uncover what happened but they dont really succeed think about it what dont we know 

 1 how she died we are never told and its never explained how she died she was swimming in a lake where the water was completely still theres no mention of any investigation over her death it actually struck me straight away youd usually expect some suspicion some lines of inquiry but theres nothing that seems so crucial but its just never addressed

2 what the nature of the relationship between alice and her neighbors was yet again this investigation dries up and then were just supposed to accept that its all done and no longer a concern

3 why was she seeing apparitions of her death and not just her she literally filmed the apparition and its confirmed to be her its just baffling how downplayed this is in the movie they literally have footage of a girls own ghost taken at the time she was still alive we get back to back shots of her corpse and this photo and its evidently her but apparently no one really cares   theres even more in the story which is left somewhat ambiguous like why she really buried her jewelry but fundamentally we dont actually know anything about her either we arent told anything specific about her personality other than the fact she liked to keep secrets everything that is said about her is just stuff that people observed before her death and its very general like she was well liked   

right at the end of the movie we have a scene which i think emphasizes this very much and also makes a point of the fact alice is still not resting and in fact she is just being forgotten about yet again her mysteries continuing june goes back for one more meeting with ray in this scene we have alices meeting spliced in between   

it is heavily implied that in her meeting alice was seeing the future as she apparently has the power to do alice says someone is coming to her door june says shes going towards alices door ray tells june to go inside and she does reluctantly alice says her mother has come into the room ray asks alice what her mother is saying she says shes not saying anything she doesnt know im here ray asks june whats in the room she says nothing alice says her mother is leaving june wakes up and looks at ray   

straight after this scene we have the family leaving the house and putting the past and alice behind them they say the house feels calm that they can be a family again and just generally imply theyre moving on we even see her brother and mother sitting on the bench in their garden laughing the same one alices ghost appears on in the photo after this we have a series of photos showing that alice was watching them the entire time but noone noticed these in the videos or pictures   

the only things anyone noticed were forgeries her brother at the lake not her other people in the footage but they never noticed her no one knows this girl seemingly she was well liked and loved supposedly and yet noone knows a damn thing about her and noone seems to care all that much sure her family are upset overall and get angrysad when they find the footage of her fucking the neighbors they wonder about why its there but not really they dont try to look for the truth they just want to satisfy their own sense of moving past it   

the father does this straight away with work and alice literally confronts him as a ghost to try to get him to look into it more which somewhat catalyses the story but then it still ends unsatisfying  noone ever seems to look for the truth in this movie everything connected with alice is completely unsolved and yet everyone just moves on like it has been solved sure we find out some more information about her but we still dont really know who she is or what happened to her we just know a bit more about the events leading up to her death  

its heavily implied by the ending of the movie that alice still isnt at rest and that shes actually just been forgotten or the family have moved on without her part of that is moving from the house which also gives the impression she will just remain in the house waiting for someone to actually solve her death   now look i think this could be just bad writing or it not being fully formulated before it was finished i dont know but there really is so much ambiguity about her death and we never find out anything about it we find out she kept secrets had sex with her neighbor buried some stuff and saw visions of her own death what does that actually tell us about her death  

nothing and yet the film ends and the family move on seems to me the whole point of the movie was alice trying to figure out whyhow she was going to die and prevent it burying her stuff going to the medium etc and then dying anyway then she tries to haunt her family so theyll find out but they ignore her and move on  

also i noticed it seems like theres a somewhat abandoned or just extremely vague implication that her brother murdered her hes the last one to be with her in the water where she died he mysteriously gets bruises all over himself at one point and this is never explained was she attacking him for what hed done he doctors the footage for his family which is clearly something he plans as he starts getting more into photography right after her death whatever the reason is for this or why he would want to be able to do it or to convince his family they were being haunted he also doesnt see the real haunting that is occurring in the photos  

think about what you actually watched and it just feels kind of empty to me way more questions are posed than that are answered and yet were supposed to accept that everything is finished in the families eyes yet clearly its not from the ending   even the movie seems selfaware that the mystery is still yet to be solved alice remaining in the house and yet the family move on as if it is if anything this movie just gives the horrible message that if you die under extremely mysterious circumstances no one not even your own family will care enough to try and figure it out before running away from where it all happened the real horror for me is the idea that as individuals we may never be truly known by others while were alive even if were wellliked after our deaths people may realize they never truly knew us but the living are so caught up with moving forward in life that they cant be bothered to care 

i think a lot of the movie is about being alone and unknown in life and in death",0,6856,1284

0.0,subst,"a bit of preamble to set the mood i was raised in a very rural isolated section of america  right on the michigan wisconsin border where its mostly forests and dilapidated old farms and miles and miles of the longest most secluded old highways in the northern half of the country  

ive always contended that the area itself is often so spooky that the location alone is perfect for the horror genre  its the kind of iconic environment  like the salt mines in day of the dead or the caves in the descent  that is so unnerving in its own right that it can be unsettling even when nothing overtly threatening is happening 

i have to travel a lot of distance in this area on a regular basis as ive driven by myself on these trips my thoughts have turned to those things that truly scare me as a result i  have been toying for a few years now with a concept for a horror film set in the area combining the environment with in my opinion one of the scariest things a person can experience in every day life  encountering another person on these lonely back roads the problem is i dont fully know how to translate that concept to a full fledged story 

i dont have anything concrete  i have a few visuals in my head a hand full of scenes an idea for the protagonist  primarily however it all centers around the one visual ive always been most afraid of headlights at night  

in my opinion there is nothing scarier in the world than headlights on a dark night when youre traveling down a broken old highway through ghost towns and cow pastures and thick forests at 2 in the morning for god knows what reason and suddenly after hours of emptiness two little specs of light come winding out of the darkness behind you thats an immediate and palpable tension i suspect a lot of people can relate to  

im looking for someone who might be interested in working with me as a writing partner and helping to flesh out this really basic concept i admittedly am not the best at really forming whole stories as a writer and i often have difficulty beginning and completing things because of that im good at concepts  individual scenes i can write pretty good dialogue from time to time as well what i really need is someone good with structure beginning middle and end that would be willing to have a back and forth communication to give more life to this kernel of an idea and then help to translate that into a full fledged script  

im open to any kind of collaboration ideas anybody might have so if this sounds appealing at all to anyone hit me up the worst that can happen is that nothing gets written",1,2592,480

so does anyone know the record for most on screen kills in a slasher or an estimate i have looked and cant find it i have found total kill numbers but they are scewed af i dont mean a war happening on screen then it being announced 1000 people died or like the girl in the rings crazy body count that werent really on screen kills but every list counts them as or the earth being wiped out by something i mean the most fully on screen that slasher in front of your eyes no cuts to black kills a person on screen kills in a movie as of right now its varyingincreasing but we are looking to have 2024 on screen kills

0.0,subst,"weve all seen one of these horror flicks the ones who premise was intriguing but they either ended up poorly executed badly acted poorly written or devolved into the same old same old tricks and cliches of the genres 

obviously this is subjective and entirely a matter of opinion but im interested to hear what movies you thought held such promise only to be disappointed by 

my top two are ghost ship and sam was here 

ghost ship has hands down the most gorgeous horror wise beginning ever committed to film 
but after that it just falls flat with cheap jump scares a trite plot and an utter waste of an idea 

if you have a grim reaper who can only take souls at sea that should be your main plot not some heistsalvageghost revenge premise such a waste 

sam was here was somewhat intriguing and the idea was unique enough that i desperately wish they had gone further with it a guy cant leave a desert town all locals are hostile and the radio station is running a smear campaign against him 

the problem is that they spent so much time on atmosphere that the actual story was super muddled had more care been given to dialogue radio broadcasts etc the ending would have had far more impact and actually tickled at making sense as opposed to what it was instead audiences are left with a great big huh at the end no clear connection between bad guy and plot let alone climaxending and plot and it leaves you feeling like the film was more concerned with trying to be clever than actual story telling and im not even one of those who needs everything tied up neatly and clearly explained but some threads of connection are required

you know the number one thing i though through out watching the blair witch project was shut up heather and i get that the blair witch projects legacy is important in horror but it just didnt do anything for me

blair witch on the other hand added something fresh to the story

now i am a person who doesnt like when unnecessary back story is added to films ex rob zombies halloween and rings but i liked this

i mean sure a lot of the characters were annoying but they went into the blair witch house we saw part of a creature the scene where the girl is crawling through that tunnel was so claustrophobic breaking the stick figure and the girl snapped in half

i figured in blair witch project the blair witch controlled the woods and thats why they couldnt find their way out apparently not every thought that and blair witch confirmed it

and i know this is a super unpopular opinion but i actually like when we get to see the monster

0.0,subst,"i actually replied with this comment on the recent post about the original movie but thought id make a post so more people would see it 

not many people know about this but the filmmakers tried crowd funding a sequel a few years back multiple times actually the last time it was to produce a comic book series in hopes of selling enough to fund the movie i assume they never made their goal because i havent heard any news from them in years

if anyone is interested you can buy the comic book series on their website httpswwwvernonsfarmhousecomshop

it is an official prequelsequel but im a huge fan of the original and i was kind of disappointed by this it feels kind of rushed and not well edited 

i really hoped they could get the movie done at some point but i just dont see it happening i would still recommend anyone who is a fan of the original to check this out because it does still scratch that itch i still have hopes they make the movie some day but its unlikely especially with the death of scott wilson a few years ago",1,1035,195

0.0,subst,"in popular culture there was a long fascination with the 80s beginning around 2003 and continuing until we got so sick of reaganism that we started burning the country down to get rid of that manure so ive seen the 80s through many lenses i remember how the 80s were mocked in the 90s something ive never seen regarding any other decade ie i cant recall people in 2011 talking smack about the 2000s  partly that was driven by a sweeping change in pop culture where much of the 80s was kindling for the fires that later burned  and burn again really   


people lived through this time of conformity i didnt sell out i bought in was a real concept in an era where 401ks were new ronald reagan held a national celebration of ice cream nancy reagan gave children a laundry list of drugs to try and they literally made fun of aids in white house press conferences the press laughed along with the politicians and people who didnt agree with this bullshit some of them made movies   


im unsure why slashers are the genre everyone thinks of when considering the 80s definitely there are some great slasher movies in the era yet the genre was clearly made whole in the 70s with halloween 1978 friday the 13th was released in 1980 was filmed in the summer of 1979 and of course psycho a film of the 60s is just too ahead of its time to be properly situated in a convenient chronology   


friday the 13th and nightmare on elm street would on their own make the 80s relevant but they are some of the best horror films of the 80s part of the spirit of the 80s was to laugh along with the villain in some voyeuristic journey to taste darkness  horror comedy was revitalized

disclaimer i am a white western transgender man though i watched both these films with my indian woman best friend and listened to her opinions if that gives me any more perspective

warning spoilers ahead big and specific ones tagged but small ones not so much

bulbbul was my more recent watch saw it last night i think its a recent release also its bollywood and its set in a historical setting in 1881 the story is that of an abused child bride the eponymous bulbbul married off to an older man at five years old becoming gt a mankilling witch goddess who murders abusive men and is distinguished by her backwards feetlt the movie is framed nonlinearly with a now storyline of her childhood love satya the younger brother of her arranged husband trying to solve the murders that locals claim were done by the demon woman and interwoven flashbacks showing the abuses and events that brought bulbbul to this point

frankly i didnt like the way this movie handled its very interesting premise the idea was full of promise and i was very excited to see this movie however i didnt like how it ended up playing out 

i saw another review call it overdirected and underwritten and this seems to sum up a large part of my thoughts on why it wasnt as good as it could have been it was a very beautiful movie with its red mist and black shadows based gothicinspired night shots of the murders and the rich indian costuming in the day scenes along with clever angles and editing it suffered in places from bizarrely unnecessary poorly cgied backdrops which seem almost ubiquitous in south asian horror but otherwise was definitely a feast for the eyes and i think the shot directing and costume departments both should be commended

however the mystery was simplistic to the point where it was almost unbelievable that it took certain characters in the movie so long to figure out the twist that we as the audience had guessed at least an hour before

more damningly i didnt like how the movie handled its reallife social issue plot child brides abuse of women and sexual assault are very real issues in indian society and not just of course in india but worldwide however the way bulbbul used these issues seemed more gratuitous than respectful there is a place for implication when it comes to the brutalization of women or anyone else onscreen for example i did not need to see gtbulbbuls rapist brotherinlaw have sex to the point of orgasm with her semiconscious bedridden from her husbands abuse bodylt in order to know that gtshe was rapedlt grindhouse horror and exploitation films are of course a genre of their own but this was not what this film was billed it and overall i found that it used gratuitous scenes of brutality to substitute for actual scares as the rest of the plot especially the supernatural elements were more gory fairytale than actual horror

kanika i watched a while ago it is a marathi film rather than bollywood which pulls heavily from films like the ring with its creepy little girl ghost kanika tells the story of gta ghost of a small girl who was killed by her father due to his desire for a son being helped to exact revenge on everyone possibly involved by her vengeful imprisoned motherlt once again gtfemale infanticidelt is a very pertinent social issue in many cultures unlike bulbbul kanika does not make use of a period setting as it is set in modern day

the scares in kanika are familiar but nonetheless provide a pleasing shot of adrenaline it shares its gory practical effects green filter and bleak bleachedout hospital scenes with many other films in the genre and uses them decently well once again the narrative incorporates flashbacks that slowly reveal to the main characters who the ghost girl is and why she is killing but these are more straightforward flashbacks not the nonlinear dreamlike narrative of bulbbul

the mystery of kanika felt much more satisfying than that in bulbbul with kanika it took me as the audience almost as long as it took the main characters to figure out exactly what this movie was about i knew it was about a social issue but i did not know going in which one and i was intrigued to find out furthermore i found the choice to make the protagonists gtdoctors implicated in various ways in the events that led kanikas father and grandmother to murder herlt and thus in a way guilty themselves very interesting as it complicated the unraveling of the mystery as they were forced to confront their own complicity in a toxic social structure that allows these kind of atrocities

the movie itself was a simple guiltypleasure ghost movie with an intriguing and heartbreaking mystery at its heart but i certainly found its handling of the realworld issues at its core much more sensitive than bulbbul we gtwitness the young kanikas murder at her fathers handslt and later also gtthe poisoning of her father and grandfather by her vengeful motherlt but these scenes do not come off as excessive or gratuitous they are rather more sensitively shown i also liked the plot making it clear that gtkanikas grandmother encouraged her father to murder herlt as it let in the morallygrey shades of a society in which women contribute to perpetuating misogynist ideals and actions overall i left kanika feeling sick to my stomach because of the implications not the visuals and i found the revenge that kanika gtand her motherlt exacted satisfying even if the characters killed were not always directly implicated in the crime i felt sympathy for those behind these murders and understood their anger

overall both kanika and bulbbul are worth a watch but if you want typical horror and a good mystery go for kanika if you want a simple but at points sickeningly gory fairytale with gorgeous period costumes go for bulbbul",0,6088,1059

my point is that that tension slow build up and visual hints all seem to be gone in modern horror movies at least in the way that this movie made me feel the closest movie i can think of is the anxiety the carnut allergy scene in hereditary made me feel so is it the dread that is missing from modern horror or have i missed the mark",0,886,176

0.0,subst,"so i know im 10 years late to this party but here goes  ive read a lot about this film both here and elsewhere and i realize that its incredibly polarizing

general consensus seems to be that people either love it or hate it  most seem to fall in the hate category  i watched it  earlier today and since then i cant get it out of my head  i think i liked it  i may even love it but im still processing what i saw and probably need to do a rewatch

ive always been a sucker for a slow burn horror movies where things begin off kilter and then gradually spiral into straightup insanity and b films about being lost in the woods  this movie pushes both buttons

from what ive reada major point of consternation about this movie is its ending which offers no clear answers about what the hell happened and is frankly  wide open to  multiple interpretations

however when you stop and think about the fact that its characters are investigating the unsolved disappearance of an entire towns population a vague ending probably makes perfect sense

not all of them though they still have to be well written well acted have a decent story and to an extent special effects  i dont want to be pulled out of it by shoddy muppet looking demons

if i was to give an example of a film that scared me recently and for this id have to go back quite a few years id say the beginning of insidious  up until they show the demon in his little workshop sharpening tools  that totally killed it for me  not scared at all after that and perhaps a couple of the conjuring films  there really arent that many 

oh and parts of hereditary but not all of it some of it was a bit laughable in places their teenage boy massively overacts in the scene where they stand holding hands around the table  it broke all the illusion for me i was more freaked by the subtle shadowy figure of her mum appearing in front of her in the darkened room near the start after her funeral  that shit me up real nice

as for other examples id have to go back even further and say the first poltergeist the exorcist the entity the blair witch project only the end part probably more i cant remember

as for other subgenres i can watch slashers zombie flicks scifi aliens type films serial killers abstract stuff pretty much all of it i enjoy rather than feeling any genuine fear sure i might feel tense for the characters in danger but fear is definitely not on my mind

the only type of horror that actually scares me is supernatural

beyond the door 1974 italian combo ripoff of both the exorcist and rosemarys baby a demon possesses the body of a pregnant mother of two and she have has crazy sex dreams and swears and spits up pea soup during her waking hours  her younger son ate campbells peas soup all the time and they even had a warhol homage on the wall it drags at nearly 2 hours but the end was ok the same year she was wearing green teeth in italy for this one lead actress juliet mills was winning an emmy for an american miniseries  originally called who are you in italian and sometimes known as the devil within her in the states 

shock 1977 mario bavas last film lamberto bava got assistant director and screenwriting credit daria nicoledi moves back into her former house with her new husband and her 10 year old boy shes a former junkie who apparently drove her late husband to suicide some force in the house controls the kid to cause his mom to suffer a few minor household accidents and she is having crazy violenterotic dreams slow paced at first but the last 20 minutes were quite exciting originally released in the us as beyond the door 2 even though the films are unrelated

all the colors of giallo 2019 pretty ok documentary with lots of clips and interviews featuring mostly the films of diario argento mario bava sergio martino lucio fulci umberto lenzzi and a few oneoffs they left out a few that i thought were important things i learned though a recorded interview with fulci was that he and dario didnt like eachother 

deathsport 1978 postapocalyptic borefest from roger cormans new world pictures has david carradine and claudia jennings captured by richard lynch to participate in government sanctioned death games with motorcycle gladiators also with lots of disintegration lasers and mutants sounds great yeah but it wasnt if not for a good amount of nudity most of it from claudia who was 1970s playmate of the year im not sure i would have made it director alan arkushs next movie would be the much more fun rock n roll high school 

the beach house 2019 a college couple and a middleaged couple share a beach house and after 50 minutes of incredibly dull character development a fog rolls in and some bodyhorror stuff starts to happen i know a lot of people like the slow burn these days but it took me right out of the game by the time anything happened i already didnt care anymore might have worked better as a part of an anthology",0,4073,737

so i found summer camp on vudu and gave it a shot expecting the usual tropes of bad acting worse effects and terrible characters but i was actually happily surprised it had several little red herrings that would keep you guessing towards a cliche when they turn it around suddenly 

it is about 4 friends who want to open a summer camp in a foreign country the evening before the camp opens however something causes the friends to turn against each other in a very evil dead manner

the gore is pretty sweet and the characters at least 2 of them were strong and very likable enough to root for  i even liked the ending which is honestly what i feared would ruin the film totally didnt

i mean this is no redefining genre film but i totally put it with other different style of slashercamping movies lileke shrooms and whatnot

sorry if this is a poor description the movie was pretty confusing and more of a psychological thrillerhorror 

the story line was a husband and wife had recently loss their child in a traumatic way the fathers grief was far more intense and longer lasting than the mother the father started thinking he was going insane because he started to see his dead daughter in his house as if she never died the mother was worried about him and he was having psychotic fits and night terrors 

eventually he starts looking into quantum psychics and multidimensional theories and tries to figure out a way create a new reality for him in his wife where their daughter never died he ends up being successful in bringing his daughter back but from my understanding whatever reality he put them in was one in which the mother carried the grief of their daughter even though she was alive it was kind of like postpartum depression except her daughter was maybe 10 years old then all this physics stuff started kicking in and the worlds start shaking like crazy and all the characters end up being like particles instead of people on and off for a few minutes theyre in their backyard and theyre all freaking out hugging while they scream together my guess is they were entering and exiting dimensions beyond the 3d back and forth for a few minutes im dont quite remember how it ended and i definitely had a poor understanding of the movie so i apologize if this description is sub par

it also talks about some of what is happening with clive barkers plan to grab back hellraiser 

to me the article looks like bad news it looks like victor miller will win ultimately but he will only get the rights to the original friday the 13th and those elements which originates there everything that originates after that will belong to cunningham so miller would get camp crystal lake pamela voorhees and kid jason which might mean that adult jason would be in limbo since the character originated with miller but the image as we think of him came from later movies so maybe cunningham could make a movie about a hockey mask wearing killer who is never referred to as jason and doesnt stalk near crystal lake or maybe any lake or any camp  which would probably suck 

as the article points out theres probably already a lot of money left on the table halloween 2018 made 255 million alone all 12 friday the 13th movies made about 475 million if they are dumb enough to not settle the matter now i do not know why they would be after the appeals court decides so we may have to look forward to some other kind of friday the 13th where a headless pamela voorhees stalks counselors and another one where a fake jason stalks people on i dunno like a river rafting trip",0,1499,255
0.0,subst,"we have seen the delay of higher budget horror like halloween kills jigsaw quiet place 2 etc these are movies studios expect massive returns from they dont want to release them if they dont have high confidence that

1 most theaters internationally will be open
2 most of the demographic for that movie will be comfortable with going to a theater
3 theater capacity is high enough to support any social distancing protocols applicable in each region say a theater limits itself to 50 capacity a movie like it which i had to wait in a long line for will now have a line twice the length and perhaps requiring a virtual queue this also puts an upper limit on movie revenue many people if they cant see a movie on friday night wont want to go see it saturday at noon this could put off many people see 2

the odds of 13 happening seems rather low even if 100 countries have the virus under control if 10 dont that is reduced revenue for the studio i think the key part is international here 

i think once we have a vaccineetc 13 will occur within a couple months but since these movies release schedules are planned out way in advance there is a delay there too

it seems likely to me that no big budget movies of any genre will be released in 2020

however if some theaters are open studios are basically wasting a potential revenue stream if they dont release anything

my thinking is studios will use this time to offload movies that had a low enough budget and have low enough profit expectations that studios dont mind releasing them in nonideal conditions such as january in the us most people are getting busy at work in many regions it is snowing or ice cold etc or in the present situation

0.0,subst,"so i just watched jeff browns 2019 shudder original film the beach house and i have some thoughts on some of its themes subtexts and even a few hidden plot messages i think could have some baring 

first of all i enjoyed this movie its bombastic spirit of lovecraft 50s scifi and even some fun nods to the likes of alien amp john carpenters the fog 
i also enjoyed the knowledge that this film is apparently very much based on an actual beach vacation turned break up the writerdirector went through in his real life that made things more fun

despite some expletive laden reviews i read on shudder i thought the acting was well done and very supportive to the story these characters were trying to tell even among those who had very few lines of actually dialogue to do so the tension between the respective couples and their struggles rang true without much background into their lives prior to the events taking place the awkwardness sadness and stress all felt very human to me  

now before i get too caught up in review land heres what i am thinking is beneath the surface of this film no pun intended and maybe some of you fine horror fiends can talk me down off my ledge with this or hopefully agree and call me a genius
i think it is as much a tale of millennial anxiety and the feeling of being on the forefronts of a losing battle to save a dying world with absolutely no hope of doing so as it is a fun summer creature feature with an underlying sub plot of an uncomfortable tail spinning relationship between two confused twentysomethings condemned to 
die in a deserted offseason beach town

my reasoning for inking such broad strokes into thematic catastrophe is that to me each character is a representative for a different piece of the puzzle in modern society and the invasive creatures overtaking them could be a blanketed representation of all of its problems as they seem to continue to pile up and compound into further complexity   

take emily for example our female lead to me she is the portrait of all that is good and hopeful in the youth of today in regards to carrying on the torch of the next generation to some meaningful maybe even habitable place to exist in she is bright caring curious thoughtful enduring educated kind and brave in fact in so far as the film allows us into her personal life her only flaw seems to in her association with her boyfriend randell 

to me randell is representative of the portion of the millennial generation or really any generation that has become brutally pessimistic resigned conscienceless or without a hope for a tomorrow he is privileged capable but lazy fearful dismissive especially of emily or her dreams and cowardly this is clearly shown when he insists very hastily that emily drop out of grad school and simply hide away in his fathers beach house with him for a few years very forward thinking randell

now to me the older couple mitch and jane turner seem to basically represent the older generations particularly the boomers and the various issues they collectively face today including those issues within the generation divide between them and their younger counterparts particularly their resignation to watch the world burn without a care one way or the other if for no other reason that they simply wont be in it much longer dramatic yes but this horror we are talking about here irrational paranoia are like chum in the waters for our fear they the turners are displayed as being so far behind on the problems of the times and so out of touch with anything outside of their own bubble of reality that they simply nod along and smile trying desperately to just keep their heads down paying attention to their baseball as mitch puts cheekily mentions in a conversation with emily 
this notion is supported several times throughout the film first when emily is explaining the inner workings of her science studies to jane who follows along only half coherently after ingesting some primo pot browniesno doubt a ham handed delivery system to simultaneously add to randells character development as cynical nonempatheic and irresponsible as well to as add credibility to the sequence of hallucinatory effects taking hold at the tendrils of the mysterious sea creatures swilling around inside of their bodiesin the very air they are breathing 
the lack of awareness is also seen when mitch later gives his unsettling confession to emily of simply trying to have one last trip with his wife before she passes of what is only vaguely suggested as a terminal disease just before he walks off into the ocean never to be seen again if i were trying to find a better metaphor for the complexity of the issues faced between the cross generational gap in america today i would be hard pressed to find one that works as well as this one does

it all comes to a head when emily ditches a white eyed doomed randell thank god drives off aimlessly through a fog or giant lovecraftian spore cloud thick enough to cut with a butcher knife and crashes into a tree all of which eventually leads somehow turning up on a beach the next morning where she has clearly been ravaged by the tiny invasive sea creatures just as presumably every other character we have met has been we know this because she is pale lifeless clammy and afflicted with eyes that are a a creepy unsettling blue that gave me nightmares  her last words before being washed away off screen are dont be scared dont be scared dont be scared dont be scared

this is the state of things this is the new normal this is the daily reminder we tell ourselves as we step into each new day filled with anxiety fear and a low level dread in the knowledge that whatever horrible new information that is coming around the bend next is our problem to deal with and that we may have absolutely no idea how to identify what it is at its core or how to face it
its like we are being invaded and have a capacity to deal with it more closely akin to the clunky dial up tone computers of our childhoods than that of the high speed demands that feel expected of us increasingly with each passing day boooo weeee ooh eeeh oooh boop 
we feel like we are being pushed out to sea without a paddle a flotation device or even a convenient air breach in our space ship for which to cast the phallic acid spewing creature out into deep space with see ripley 
when just yesterday our problems were grad programs unexpected guests and shitty control freak boyfriends today they are vague mysterious enemies that attack us by air by water they are already inside of us ancient new vaguely biological and unidentifiable even to the student

not only indicative of this next random catastrophe that we all seem to be waiting for but the creatures are also the collective snowballing in a laundry list of mounting social and environmental issues that demand immediate action but have no definite solution climate change political discourse in fighting racial tensionsinjustices the looming threat of nuclear war and a coming extinction and interestingly enough an actual pandemic this film was first screened in 2019 during the brooklyn horror film festival just before the outbreak of covid had taken hold and its almost chilling how well this still fits here on our list 

we feel overwhelmed constantly stressedanxious and powerless 

for those of us who arent the randells of our world we all know at least one and probably more there is a sense of dread unease and often times a rationally sound hopelessness going into each day as we say to ourselves dont be scared",0,7572,1339

i think thats a great premise for a darkly comical sawlike thriller but wyr seems to slow down the pace considerably once the game actually starts being played with 30 of the movie just being the people electrocuting each other and 25 consisting of one guy getting hit with a stick repeatedly the movie also blue balls us with some of the most brutal dares not actually being the ones picked by the players i think a sequel that turns the game up to 11 would be really good because i personally think would you rather was a great idea wasted on a mediocre film",1,1042,193

hello everyone

im making a story for a horror game which ill eventually make

this is just a demo intro to the story and i would love to hear your opinion and suggestions for it

 the year is 1993 and a few teenagers decided to check out a haunted house down the street the house was more like a mansion and they heard a lot of stories about the horrors that happen in it 20 years ago one 17year old kid named vincent went to the mansion and was never seen again some say the mansion is alive some say that there are beasts inside

once they arrived at the front gate they mocked mark how he cant enter it after a few minutes he went through the gate as other followed after couple of steps they all felt a cold breeze and felt shivers throughout their whole bodies as mark turned around to check on the others he realized that hes all alone

when he came back to his senses he felt something calling him to the slightlyopened front door of the mansion

when he got to the porch the door opened and he heard a deep male voice coming from the house that said welcome

right after he went through the door slammed shut in front of him and couldnt be opened again

mark realized that the only thing he could do was to look for his friends and try to get out of here

he entered a big room with wooden staircase in the middle that went upwards and separated in different directions below each staircase were rooms there was a muffled noise coming from the right room suddenly that door opened and a huge skinny pale humanoid figure was standing at the doorway covered in bloody and ripped cloth the face of the humanoid seemed ripped apart in half there were muscles and skin hanging he left a bloody trail from the fresh wound and it was so deep that you could see his cheekbone

when nicole 3rd floor woke up she felt lightheaded like she was drugged she found herself sitting below a window that was illuminated by the moon as the girl stood up she noticed that she was standing in a long hallway full of doors the walls of the hallway were filled with old and creepy portraits she felt disgusted and frightened by the sight

cory 2nd floor was woken by the sound of intercom ringing

he was confused but didnt answer the intercom right away while he was rubbing his eyes he found himself in a medium sized room with full furniture and a mirror that had a strange glow

cory was amazed by the mirror but the constant ringing from the intercom annoyed him so he answered it it was tracy who was frightened and was crying on the line

tracy 5th floor felt a childlike hand waking her up when she opened her eyes she saw a dwarf covered in blood and holding on a bloody cleaver she jumped away from him and started screaming the dwarf tried to calm her down and told her that he doesnt want to hurt her but suddenly tracy saw a hand piercing through his stomach while he let out his last breath tracy heard him whisper run

while she was running she quickly entered the first door she stumbled upon after closing and securing the door with a chair she saw an intercom and tried to contact anybody who can help her

tracy was amazed to hear a familiar voice it was corys

ground floor

 the whole room was lit up by dimmed lanterns and chandeliers

old dusty furniture with giant spider webs could be found here and there in the room some of them are partially destroyed chairs with missing handles or partially missing backrests were laying on the floor the colorful carpet that was going up the stairs was either ripped either from the wooden floor or maybe by something else and it was burnt in certain places

at the top of the main stair case was a big painting of a ghoulishlike man in a suit that looked frightened like it saw something monstrous besides that there were other paintings

on the right side of the ghoulishlike man was a painting of a black shorthaired woman posing on a red french sofa just like your average french girls she was wearing a light beige night gown that was to her ankles she had a long neckless with a red piece of jewelry on it in her hair there were two white lilies on each side that reminded of cat ears in her left hand she was holding a pink rose in the back of the sofa was a long crumbled curtain that filled the whole background

on the left side of the ghoulishlike man was an oil painting of a screaming girl with long black hair the figure of a girl seemed like it was she was very skinny her face was smudged and you couldnt see her eyes from her bangs and her whole face was a bit deformed she was standing in some kind of a dark room or space but there was some luminance coming from the left side of the painting in the left bottom corner something was written the sentence that was written was nascentes morimur

wallpapers were also ripped so it must be that something really big and strong came roaming through this mansion the wallpaper had a mosaiclike pattern the walls were also damaged in some places also there was fresh blood splattered here and there on the wall when you look closer in the damaged parts of the wall you could see the planks that made the wall

the floor seemed to be partially eaten by termites there were visible holes in it the other part of floor seemed like it was made out of ashes

if you went upstairs you could see a kind of a balcony that sounded the lower floor handrail had missing pieces if you touched it you could feel something moving through it maybe the stories were true maybe the mansion was alive

on the left side of the staircase there was a big gap on the handrail did something jumped through it or just threw something at it if you looked from the point of the gap there was a shattered chair right in front of it it looked like something was floating behind the handrail and the chair smashed right into it

the red shattered carpet continued throughout the higher floor on each side there were staircases that led up to the rest of the mansion

wallpapers on this floor were different they were striped with darker and brighter shades of red the darker shade seemed thicker if you touched that shade it felt like fresh paint but it was something different after rubbing it you realized it was blood the blood was dripping through the walls in even parts making the perfect stripes on the walls",1,6302,1183

also like how she destroys the town
also i feel bad for carrie she isnt sissy but she plays vulnerable well so when the pigs blood is poured on her i cry 

also found the gyms destruction super intense with the music and all the flying objects good to see all the bad kids get their just deserts

theres shock also released as of course beyond the door ii from 1977 directed by mario bava which follows a family moving into an old house that ends up being haunted by the ghost of the wifemothers exhusband who died in an accident at sea many years prior he possesses the son of the family amp some mildly oedipal themes emerge however things arent what they seem with the story amp several twists are revealed throughout its a typical batshit crazy 70s flick that makes very little sense but does feature some enjoyable effects for the time amp neat shots 

then theres beyond the door iii aka amok train released over a decade after the last entry into the franchise in 1989 starring a bunch of actors who went on to do a whole lot of nothing amp a few that had pretty lengthy careers its an absolute trainwreck pun intended sue me of a movie that i cannot recommend in good faith its that bad the story makes less than no sense its all over the place from beginning to end amp the acting is not good it revolves around an evil train hence the alternate title that kills people amp stuff and may or may not be possessed by literal satan as well as this demonic cult who are trying to sacrificebetroth the main heroine to their master the devil because shes a virgin i dont even know if thats the actual plot or not because it was hard enough to grasp amp i struggled to pay much attention past the halfway point

the relatable survivor 

 stereotypical everyman  everywoman an average person from a humble background 
 has littletono combat or survival skills usually relies on practicality and their common sense to evade the monsters  killers and solve problems 
 constantly on the edge of a nervous breakdown
 seemingly weak and inept but can accomplish surprisingly impressive feats if backed into a corner 

the tired survivor 

 lowkey depressed uses dissociation and aloofness as a defense mechanism against things that make them scared or uncomfortable
 has cripplingly poor selfesteem but will try to fight a god out of pure spite 
 most likely has some form of past trauma which explains why theyre so emotionally detached theyve seen some shit 
 reacts to grotesque horror with curiosity or cold indifference 

the soldier survivor 

 has experience with fighting and is capable of defending themselves 
 acts like they arent bothered by all the crazy shit theyve witnessed but are secretly disturbed by it 
 usually the first to volunteer to distract the monsters  killers in order to buy time for others to escape 
 levels of intelligence can vary but theyre usually smart enough to know when something isnt right 

the innocent survivor 

 too good for all of the horrible things they endure most likely comes from a very sheltered and comfortable background 
 has a mini heart attack every time they hear a scary noise when it comes to fight or flight they will almost always choose to run away 
 can come off as naive or too trusting of others easily manipulated or lured into a trap 
 if they survive they will have some serious emotional scarring to deal with and need therapy 

the investigator survivor

 usually a detective journalist or scientist theyre inquisitive personality makes them natural problem solvers 
 can be a bit of a jerk and a smart ass but they sympathize with those who are most shookup or victimized by whatever chaotic situation they are in 
 prefers to observe monsters  killers from a distance instead of directly engaging them 
 isnt afraid to ask the tough questions often clashes with other survivors when things get tense 

the hermit survivor

 gives off feral vibes didnt fit into society well even before the horror began 
 will beat you up if you look at them the wrong way while usually not outright malicious they arent afraid to get their hands dirty 
 a stubborn lone wolf that dislikes working with others acts like a badass to mask their insecurities and fears 
 determined to accomplish their goal no matter what whether its simply for survival revenge or trying to prove to themselves that they arent weak",0,2934,485

0.0,subst,"okay first off im fully aware that these two examples are so vague that they are almost certainly unintentional but i thought some of you might find this as weirdly interesting as i do

the first example comes from a similarity i noticed in the way drew barrymore says michael  michael myers  when answering a question in the opening of scream

hopefully my timestamp works if not skip to 135

httpsyoutubeiiiduc2syuit95

now compare that to the way jamie lloyd says it also over the phone in the opening of the curse of michael myers

httpsyoutube57p4gah6zbwt50  timestamp 0050

this is something i noticed a long time ago but always felt weird trying to bring up to other people because im pretty sure its just a coincidence


i was also thinking about scream 2 recently and how a scene in that reminded of a scene from friday the 13th part 5  a new beginning

when i first saw a new beginning i was aware that the killer would be a copycat not the real jason but i had no idea who the killer would be  then a random ass paramedic has some lines for no reason and it quickly became clear that he would be the killer  why else would they bring attention to him by giving him lines

it reminded me of the part in scream 2 where the eventual reveal of the killer being billys mother is sort of hinted at by having one of the rabble of journalists seen several times not only be given plenty of lines but also be played by laurie metcalf an actress most people would recognise

that is compounded when gail refers to the reporter as local woman

it seemed so hamfisted the first time i saw it because it clearly hinted that the reporter had a bigger part to play in the movie as a whole

it becomes less hamfisted when i started to wonder if it was an intentional reference to a new beginning and the way they handled introducing a new killer

the fact that she turns out to be billys mother also seems to subtly reference friday the 13th so maybe this was intentional

like i said both probably coincidental but i had some time to kill so i thought id share

have any of you noticed any similar stuff in the scream movies  or any movies",0,2135,397

0.0,subst,"so i discovered another schlocktacular movie that i somehow own and i remember watching this once but i only remember the dad being abducted and turned into a weird dog alien thing and that movie is xtro a 1982 british science fiction horror movie directed by hhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiharry_bromley_davenportarry bromleydavenport starring bernice stegers phttpsenwikipediaorgwikiphillip_sayerhillip seyer and shttpsenwikipediaorgwikisimon_nashimon nash

the synopsis of the movie reads tonys father sam abducted by aliens three years earlier returns to earth and seeks out his wife and son but rachel has since been living with joe and the reunion is awkward joe doesnt trust sam and rachel cant quite decide what her feelings are for her two men sam is not the same as when he left and he begins affecting tony in frightening ways

having watched this i think i can safely say this movie is probably the filmic equivalent of marmite you are either going to love or hate it or be ambivalent and i couldnt predict what reaction anyone would have its like a fevered nightmare of a dream with gore aplenty and lots and lots of surreal weirdness wrapped in a very british tv family drama about divorceyeah its weird but at the same time makes total sense

 in effect the whole story was really about a dads love for his family and him wanting to return to take them back to his new alien homeworld and heres the other thing all of that seemingly unconnected weirdness i just described has an in film setup build up and pay off if you are paying close enough attention to what is happening in every scene which is what makes xtro stand out amongst most bmovies most bmovies set things up then never pay them off or just have pay offs come out of thin air and long stretches of boring exposition

and thats one thing you could never accuse xtro of being boring something is always happening on screen and the use of lighting practical effects and clever camera angles make what could have been a dull bmovie into something that is worth a watch i think

but as i said before you might be one of the people who just find this far far too weird to ever make any kind of sense and hate it either is an option to be honest

i have been on a bit of a horror bender lately after an underwhelming viewing of the exorcist tv series on netflix i was looking for something with more scare

the series is in french at first i had the english dubs on but it was really distracting i understand some french so switching to subs was way better

the premise is a writer whose dreams are haunted by a witch unless she writes about said witch the series begins with her vowing to change directions and write about something else basically the whole series is switching between very quirky humour and thrilling occasionally gory horror which is a setup i really love when i watch horror with no comedic relief i get really desensitized to the horror side of things

psycho consistently good except for the fourth which ive never seen 810

the living dead franchise romero the first three are great and land is underrated everything after land is dire  its like romero forgot how to direct horror 610

the exorcist the third is better than the stellar original and even the admittedly bad second film has a lot of interesting ideas that just dont gel into a concrete whole 810

the texas chainsaw massacre the first four films are all very different and i like them all even that crazy piece of shit fourth one with its weird illuminati subplot the remake and the prequel are the definition of bland 13 is interesting but also pretty bad i havent seen the newest film 710

halloween i actually think its consistently great with the exception of the fifth movie straight to resurrection at which point it falls right into the gutter and doesnt recover until halloween 2018 710

phantasm probably the greatest horror franchise in terms of quality all five films are great including the slow as shit and plotless but supremely atmospheric oblivion all five films have different tones and yet they all feel organically connected my favorite 910

froday the 13th fun and dumb all the way through i think the third one is bland and manhattan is incoherent but id never turn down a chance to watch any of them 810

a nightmare on elm street the first three are all great and then it becomes almost unwatchable until new nightmare dream child has interesting ideas but gets too bogged down with effects wizardry to fully execute them properly 610

set on a florida college campus circa the late 80s primal rage follows an aspiring journalist his best friend also a journalist and a couple of classmates theyre pining after as they become the unfortunate victims of a virus that turns people into rabid killers 

a cheap italian effort shot in the us i didnt have especially high expectations for it but figured id wind up watching it someday anyway after it sat on my list for a few months i finally got around to checking it out amp this thing blew me away its not the best movie ever no but all things considered im not sure how this doesnt have more of a cult following its got everything you could want in cheesy 80s horror a fun soundtrack likeable characters solid acting good practical effects and an interesting plot all its missing is nudity but if thats a dealbreaker for you and i dont know anybody for whom it would be i dont know what to say

the story is pretty basic but its engaging amp nicely paced it also benefits a lot from the college campus setting the characters are sympathetic amp feel pretty human which makes seeing some of them face slow amp agonizing demise a bit sad there is this gang of frat assholes who are incredibly cartoony and over the top but they dont ruin the whole movie a few plot details dont quite add up but its easy enough to ignore them there are sprinkles of comedy here amp there some of which dont stick the landing but i laughed at most of them theres also a really neat halloween party sequence that features some of the coolest costumes i have ever seen in a movie as well as a few creative kills to up the body count seriously i want to own some of those masks 

theres definitely a bit of a made for tv vibe to this one which im sure will turn some away from it theres implied nude scenes that im honestly not sure why they arent more explicit not that it was necessary it just struck me as odd that for a lowbudget late80s italian horror flick set at a college theres zero nudity unless its paired with graphic gore speaking of most of the really bloody stuff is spaced out amp in between we get cutaways or minimal if any blood at all

0.0,subst,"released in 1974 and also commonly known as let sleeping corpses lie which is the title its listed under pretty much everywhere this is a zombie movie following two unlikely companions who on an otherwise innocent roadtrip together throughout the english countryside wind up becoming involved in the beginnings of an undead apocalypse 

is this quite possibly a night of the living dead ripoff yes absolutely is it good anyway yep is it different enough from notld to stand on its own i believe it is a strange combination of an environmental psa italian sleaze amp classic zombie films manchester morgue is a pretty good time if youre a fan of the zombie genre that offers a lot of gore to stare at and a really unique idea at its core thats arguably still relevant 

this time around it isnt a virus or anything thats causing the undead to rise out of their graves amp eat other people instead its a strange machine that uses ultrasonic radiation to kill insects by getting them to attack each other amp essentially selfexterminate unfortunately the radiation just so happens to have the side effect of bringing dead people back to life whats more interesting is that these zombies arent just eating folks to sustain their own lives but also to use human blood as a means of reviving other corpses amp building an army smart cookies these ones

beyond just the unique setup there are a lot of other pluses to this the atmosphere is very effective amp the settings are pretty neat hospitals barren country roads a cemetery nothing new of course but still fun unfortunately theres also some negatives amp the biggest one is the characters nobody is particularly likeable amp in fact the main hero george is portrayed as a total selfrighteous douchebag throughout most of the thing his companion on the journey edna is the most sympathetic of anybody but she doesnt really get to do much then theres the ending which i wasnt especially fond of but im sure itll have its fans 

overall this is a very weird entry into zombie horror and while its got some nice ideas amp impressive gore going for it it doesnt always stick the landing in terms of story or character amp that definitely makes a difference things like the aforementioned human blood thing never really get expanded on amp seem to exist just for the sake of being different amp there are some weird skips in the plot still i enjoyed it quite a bit amp i think that fans of the genre will appreciate what it has to offer even if it doesnt become an alltime favorite",1,2525,448

michael dougherty hasnt done much but trick r treat is definitely a great horror film  a blast from beginning to end and like his first film krampus is a kickass midnight flick thats gory funny and scary all at the same time a modern bmovie that what lacks in pace makes up in spirit and features an excellent twist in the homeinvasion genre

it captured the spirit of christmas in a unique way poking at so many stereotypes in its first half alone the intro is a fantastic satire to capitalism in modern america how during the holidays people transform into relentless shopping beasts that will stop at nothing even snatching gifts from peoples hands to ultimately gift to somebody else  a powerful irony that counters the true spirit of christmas

some truly fun characters as well david koechner howard and conchata ferrel aunt dorothy stole the comedy spotlight emjay anthony max was the true heavy weight who served as the backbone of the film and scott and colette were great as usual

now i can see how this film is not for everyone and why it slightly polarized critics it never goes too far on the comedy or horror end i wish it wouldve cranked it up to 11 but i guess dougherty was constrained to the pg13 rating and couldnt really take this to an insane level i dont think its intention was to appeal to a wide audience due to the obscure subject matter and visually challenging antagonists i can perfectly see how some parents might hate it or love it either way i know in the past few years its found a niche audience and over time it might even develop somewhat of a cult following

definitely worth the watch and more so if youre in the mood for a different style and subgenre of horror thats weirdly entertaining from beginning to end",1,1767,320

0.0,subst,"the slasher genre is a very interesting type of subgenre for horror as well as possibly the most popular while it could be argued if these slasher movies are actually scary or not one things for certain is that they can be very entertaining especially if you watch to see the creative kills and seeing the horror movie villain in action here is my top ten list of my favourite slasher movies i will be mentioning sequels in my list as some sequels ive enjoyed more than the first movie however my rule is simply to name one movie per franchise if it is from a franchise without further ado onto the list 

my top 10 favourite slasher movies

10 saw ii 2005  i will admit that ive never been much of a fan of the saw franchise the first two movies were the only movies i genuinely liked of the two however i would have to say that the sequel is way better its takes everything that was great about the first film and made everything better in the sequel while expanding more on the setup within this world we get to see a lot more of john kramer who became one of my favourite horror movie villains because of this movie and he absolutely steals the show in this movie we get to follow a much larger cast of characters giving us more victims to use for a lot more death traps here the death traps are a lot more fun and creative unfortunately a few characters suffer from stupidity like that chick who thought it would be smart to put both her hands in a saw box however i really loved the twist in the end 

9 happy death day 2017  just when i was getting tired of the slasher genre this movie came in and surprised me is so many ways its basically the horror version of groundhog day our main character tree is very likable and on her birthday shes always being murdered by a slasher known as the babyface killer its a really fun movie with many creative kills tree also gets a great case of character development as the films go on the sequel is nearly just as good too bad i had to choose between the two of them but i guess the first one ultimately came out on top due to it getting me back into the slasher genre i really hope happy death day 3 eventually comes because i really love this concept 

8 halloween 1978  im probably going to get a lot of hate for putting halloween a little low on my list make no mistake i really love this movie it easily has the best theme song out of every horror movie michael myers is also one of the greatest horror movie villains of all time being a silent psychopath and the embodiment of pure evil my only problem is that it is a little slow in some parts still its a very believable horror movie as laurie has no idea why michael wants to kill her so much and we the audience dont even know why making him so much more terrifying it takes loomis to shoot michael six times to knock him out for a short while only for him to escape i will say this while i love the  1981 and 2018 sequels they just dont compare to this movie its iconic for a damn good reason 

7 the texas chainsaw massacre 2003  this is one of those rare cases where i prefer the remake over the original i know the original is preferred by many as it is a classic but i just feel like this movie is a little better leatherface is not only a lot more scarier here but hes also a lot more badass also his entire family save for a small boy are all sadistic cannibals here theyre not called the sawyers but the hewitts sheriff charlie hewitt is a lot more sadistic and monstrous compared to drayton charlie takes absolute pleasure in torturing and mindbreaking his victims before slaughtering them eventually while most of the characters are a little stale this is truly one of the best remakes ive ever watched and one of the reasons why leatherface is one of my favourite horror movie villains of all time 

6 scream 1996  this movie is such a fun ride right at the beginning it instantly got me hooked this movie has a great cast of characters and i love the whole horror mystery plot for this movie giving us a whole whodoneit type of story like who is the ghostface killer i wont lie i mainly got into this movie through the parody film scary movie which is was a spoof of this and i know what you did last summer still im glad i eventually got to see this gem overall its such a great slasher film that manages to deconstruct every slasher trope and i really loved all the horror movie references in this movie 

5 childs play 2 1990  dolls are definitely a creepy concept theres something about an inanimate object coming to life thats genuinely unsettling this is what makes the childs play series one of my favourite franchises of all time it was a tough decision between the first movie and the sequel but ultimately childs play 2 came out on top this movie took everything that was great about the first film and made everything better instead of having to go through the buildup again we get to see chucky in the beginning get right into action chucky is at his absolute best here here hes still quippy but just serious enough to prove hes a horror movie villain for a damn good reason the kills are all great and memorable and that climax always has my heart racing andy is still adorable like how he was from the first movie and the colors are all much more expressive overall this is easily the best childs play film ever made

4 a nightmare on elm street 1984  this movie took our fears to our comfort zones sleeping and dreaming just the idea of having our nightmares becoming real and killing us in our sleeps is more than enough to keep us awake for a long time freddy krueger is also one of the most influential horror movie villains of all time being one of the first villains with a full personality his theme song is really chilling with the chorus of children and just the whole damn setting is terrifying freddys kills are really some of the best with the most memorable death being the johnny depp dragged into the bed death nancy is also my favourite final girl theres also a lot of great lore and backstory for freddy he was original a child serial killer and because he got out of prison the parents of the children burnt him alive now he is back to prove that not even death can save their children from freddy krueger definitely not only one of the best slasher movies but one of the best horror movies of all time

3 friday the 13th the final chapter 1984  without a doubt the best friday the 13th movie this is the movie which made jason voorhees become my favourite horror movie villain ever here he is at his best and he has so many great kills along with that this is also the one friday film that has the most likable cast in the franchise who could forget jimmys crazy dance to woo one of the twins tommy jarvis is also the most likable child protagonist in the series who is also mostly popular due to being one of the very few people to actually defeat jason voorhees jasons death in this movie is so gruesome and yet so satisfying overall this movie has definitely earned its place in my top ten list 

2 final destination 2 2003  i really love the final destination franchise its yet another interesting concept for the slasher genre instead of having a typical killer slaughtering the main characters its objects that do all the slashing my favourite of the entire franchise though is final destination 2 like with many other sequels ive mentioned on this list this movie takes everything that was great about the first film and makes the sequel so much better it expands more on the lore of this universe who death is and the deaths are a lot more graphic and well done the best part is that everything is done using practical effects where the later movies would eventually come to rely on cgi this movie perfectly has that personality by going full on practical and boy does it look amazing the road accident scene is still the best premonition scene in this whole franchise as every death is done so well i also loved how we get one of the cast from the previous movie returning and this movie is the only movie to have the main characters survive death my only complaint is that alex the main protagonist from the first movie dies offscreen by a brick of all things still with many great performances good characters and such a wellmade film this movie truly stands out as one of the best horror movies ive ever watched tony todd as the creepy william bludworth is also always great to see in these movies as well

1 the cabin in the woods 2012  this is a very unique choice for this list its not just a slasher film in fact its basically a mix of nearly every genre its got slasher in it supernatural cosmic horror horror comedy and pretty much everything else to do with horror thats why this is not only my number one favourite slasher film but my favourite horror movie of all time it basically deconstructs every horror trope in the book even using the typical teen stereotypes were so used to seeing as a plot point my favourite part is the final act where we see basically every horror monster imaginable we especially get to see nearly every one of them go beserk on the facility the best part this movie used practical effects for nearly everything making this movie all the more special so yeah i could go on and on about why this is my favourite horror movie but then id just be writing a full essay as a whole this movie is a ton of fun its got a lot of great kills and a very unique concept by using horror movie tropes to kill the victims

so thats my personal list of my ten favourite slasher films how about you guys whats your top ten favourite slasher horror films and why",1,9648,1816

0.0,subst,"hey everyone

we all know our favorite slasher franchises has a dud with no exceptions halloween has resurrection texas chainsaw 3d f13 has jason takes manhattan or jason x and hellraiser eventually went straight to video just to name a few

my favorite series has always been elm street with the idea of dying in your sleep is truly terrifying in most films when someone falls asleep we know they made it and are safe until the next day i feels thats what made elm street unique since falling asleep is inevitable 

however as the series went on freddy became more cartoonish than the demon of our nightmares we was introduced to in anoes 1 beginning with dream warriors which is my favorite elm street movie freddy started with one liners which brought him a following where the audience wanted to see freddy and what he would bring in the next film

i am a firm believer that dream child is the worst of the series as it being boring but having really cool dream sequences dans death has stuck with me for some time

but im here to talk about what we got with the final nightmare and what couldveshouldve been luckily i was only 9 months old in september of 1991 when the final nightmare came out because i wouldve been disappointed in what we got im not saying its a horrible film but it isnt what we deserved or what englund deserved as a potential send off to this iconic movie monster

with the final nightmare it is set 10 years in the future which would be 2001 alice and jacob moves away ill get back to my opinion on this and all kids are gone with the exception of 1 john doe freddy being out of new souls needs john to lure unknowing teenagers to springwood so he can get them in their dreams freddys sends john past elm street via bus and he hits his head and has amnesia this john doe was born dont get excited because he brings nothing to the table character wise he is taken to a teen center for troubled youth by cops where he is taken in an consoled by dr maggie burroughs who is one of the few bright spots for my tastes she finds a newspaper clipping and decides to take him to springwood to see if it will help spark his mind to remember 3 troubled teens stow away in the back of the van which will not be the trip of their dreams im not freddy so bad pun turns out freddy has a kid in a nutshell john begins to think he is freddys kid and thats why he is still alive flash forward past carlos death from enhanced hearing cool death spencers death via power glove and figuring out more details on tracys past as she was sexually abused by her father she kicks freddys ass john then is attacked in his dream where freddys reveals his child is a girl he tells this to maggie as he dies maggie finds her adoption papers learning she is freddys daughter enter the dream demons which a man called doc who works at the center figures out is the source of kruegers power and if pulled into the real world he can be stopped hasnt been tried for a few sequels so worth another shot maggie volunteers to go into the dream world but is given 3d glasses to enter his mind and to let the audience know the put them on for terrible 90s 3d effects in the end freddy is pulled back into the dream world after we learn he was an abused boy who was made fun of the final confrontation pits daughter against father where freddy is blew up by a piper bomb where maggie leaves him with a happy fathers day but they had to give freddy the last word with kids the dream demons leave freddy seemingly for good and we get a noes montage

sheesh what an odd movie for one it isnt horror and they made some really bold decisions

why in the world would alice and jacob leave they were supposed to destroy the sith not join themwrong movie but you catch my drift they know how to stop freddy and couldve prevented this kid less version of springwood so why make them leave rachel talalay was given so much leadway with the script as she wrote and directed this film its not bad as i have said before just not what was deserved

do you prefer the idea of the dream police where jacob must save alice and elm street from being destroyed by krueger this wouldve seen the return of joey kincaid and taryn as the dream police who are summoned whenever krueger shows up ngl sounds cool from the script however making this work and turning the series back into horror was not in this potential sequel but for me i prefer this idea over freddys dead

then peter jackson wrote a script where people wanted to go to sleep to pick on freddy as he had lost his power long story short some kid fucks up and freddy gets his power back

would you have preferred dream police

0.0,subst,"really good and original movie i was very surprised you almost want to live the way do when watching it tilda made a good point at the end about how horrible real life is and all

i understand the main point and that they keep living in their fantasy world then petula leaves forgets and comes back again this goes on for the rest of their lives apparently even the suicide was a fantasy since so much of the events was a fantasy there are few things i am not clear about

1 tildas role  the whole movie she seems to be on petulas side and like the one who gets the most abuse in her kid role but at the end she seems almost like the most domineering one and in on it with daphne so during the times when petula leaves the house does she leave with her and play along until they come back 

2 the cops and drugs are all fake but petula and maybe tilda did live outside the house off and on

3 the scene with the old guy who calls petula a witch is real we can see a play train and the movie hints that the train ride never even happened but we also know that petula leaves the house regularly

4 the cop isnt killed but what about daphnes grandparents they probably did have to kill them 

5 why is that fall incident even that important in the later context it was when it seemed that daphne was the crazy one

6 i dont think anyone can answer this but logistically how do they even live if the house is in reality not in a good condition who even goes to get food and shit  i guess daphne has money

7 the suicide is obviously fake since we see them go on until theyre old and ok there are hints that maybe even the way we see them in a movie is their fantasy of themselves when they were kids or when they are old


the only criticism i have towards the movie is that it gives some backstory that seems kind of irrelevant that fall but it doesnt explain what really made them so crazy and where everyones parents are

i thought there would be all kinds of talk about this on here because it just got released today but i havent seen much besides a post yesterday and another one 5 days ago 

but holy shit this was good 

acting was great cinematography was so goddamn good kind of ari asteresque with the wide angles and the hint of something always lurking in the background the colors were wonderful too extremely moody and gray and dark i found myself constantly looking for creepy shit in the dark background 

and it was a really good slow burn felt like it didnt waste anytime at all but towards the end there was some disturbing stuff and relatively minimal but extremely effective gore that had my fiancé and i gasping out loud 

idk man im spooked and excited a movie hasnt freaked me out in a while since hereditary maybe 

oh and if you like the book house of leaves there are a few minutes of scenes in this film that i think captured the feel of the house in that book better than anything else ive seen in a movie 

i was just shocked at how good this was have you seen it did you like it",1,1095,207
0.0,subst,"it was such a good movie its about doomsday preppers training from a well known doomsday prepper youtuber the movie had tons of little foreshadowing moments and i felt incredibly anxious the whole time watching it it even got 89 on rotten tomatoes and rt is really damn unfair and harsh to horror movies  it is definitely the best horror movie ive seen this year

the only thing that may be a turnoff for some people is that it is a frenchcanadian movie and so they speak french in it so there are english subtitles or netflix actually has an english dub of it made by the same actors but i thought watching the french version wouldve been better so the audio is in sync with the characters lips moving

0.0,subst,"this is pure speculation but  as a longtime alien fan im curious if theres any truth to it since ive been unable as of yet to find a source ive only found references to the xenomorphs inspirations from hr gigers  necronom iv  i heard someone claim recently that gigers design for the xenomorphs iconic second inner jaw was partially inspired from pharyngeal jaws found in nature ex moray eel

ampx200b

i also read about the sexual aspects of the inner jaw both in context of forcibly penetrating victims faces and the retractable teeths connection to vagina dentata but is there any documented evidence of giger citing eels or fish as an influence on his design if so this would make a lot of sense in retrospect given how the xenomorphs head always reminded me of an eel even as a kid

feedback is welcome and sources would be much appreciated thanks

i used to watch this movie when i was very little and it recently crossed my mind again i would like to rewatch it but i cannot for the life of me remember the name heres what i remember

 its not a very good movie i remember googling it years back and it wasnt rated very highly
 if i had to guess its from the 50s or 60s 
 the scene that sticks out to me the most involves the view of a cars headlights from a sort of pov position as if the camera is on the windshield or the hood driving down a road surrounded by forest on both sides 
 the car continues to drive and the headlights eventually illuminate a disfigured humanoidish figure its on all fours and it looks like its crabwalking

the burning 1981 this has everything you would want in a classic 80s slasher summer camp setting shower scene prank gone wrong and revenge actors that became famous later in life jason alexander holly hunter and possibly the single greatest actiongore scene of them all courtesy of tom savini one of the best of the genre not to be missed

def by temptation 1990 a sexy succubus is murdering nyc bar patrons the son of a preacher must resist jeez this was just awful  a succubus movie with no nudity  james bond iii was a child star in the 80s but he grew up to write direct and star in this and doesnt have another film credit for 20 years also with kadeem hardison and samuel l jackson 

lake bodom 2016 finnish slasher starts out fine 2 pairs of teens visit a camp site that had a massacre 40 years earlier but around the time of the first twist about half waythrough the characters motivations were so weak it practically knocked my brain out of the rest of the movie i mean it wasnt bad or anything and i suppose if you dont think too hard its a horror movie after all subtitles 

piranha 1978 heather menzies ssssss is a private investigator looking for two missing teens she and the mountain drunkard bradford dilman bug end up at a military testing facility where they unknowingly empty a pool of genetically altered piranha into a texas river where they eventually prey on a kids summer camp and the grand opening of a family resort joe dantes 2nd feature film for roger corman he was just getting started loaded with familiar genre faces kevin mccarthy keenan wynn dick miller barbara steele paul bartel and belinda balaski a personal alltime fave  
   
humanoids from the deep 1980 my favorite 80s ecohorror a cannery is set to open up in a pacific northwest fishing town prompting a feud between local native americans and white fisherman scientists have been feeding growth hormones to the salmon causing some of the more primitive fish to rapidly evolve into slimy fish people with an urge to reproduce gory good nudity lots of explosions fish fucking and a ventriloquist dummy who nearly gets laid in a tent doug mcclure plays the hero vic morrow the villain rob bottin the thing the howling created the humanoids and produced by roger cormans new world pictures

the private files of j edgar hoover 1977 ive always been curios about this one from larry cohen and tcm played it a few weeks ago it plays like a documentary of the 50 year fbi head broderick crawford from his rise to prominence battling mob bosses then his feud with bobby kennedy michael parks and his obsession with illegal wire taps the sleazy bits were accusations of homosexuality and the implication that he got drunk in his office and jerked off to sexually explicit audio tapes the cast of dozens also included rip torn john marley and jose ferrer not very good

so jack is cainor cayenne as he sais it himself he got punished by god whom he refers to as a she implying that god is female in this

the goateed man at the end cannot be god then so who is he death

i think it might be the devil who came to either collect steven oggs characters soul or have a deal with him if it was dearh he wouldnt have cared if jack killed him since he would claim him anyway 

as for what jackcain is

well i beleive he is a vampire but not in the classical sense 

in many media such as in the blade movies i think the vampire the masquerade franchise and others cain is mentionned as the first vampire

well jack said himself that he is the one implying he is the first and only one he eats human flesh and drinks human blood but it doesnt seem to be for sustenance as he eats other stuff he only started again in the movie when he got hurt eating flesh and drinking blood only seemed to help him heal 

but what about the stuff he got from the nurse guy you ask

well he never stopped drinking blood he just got it from a safe source to not kill anyone he is sick of killing people

basically his curse is to roam the earth for eternity while having a hunger for human flesh not for sustenance as he cannot die but just for added suffering he never liked killing people but did anyway to satiate his hunger

its been ten years since scream 4 which i honestly think was ahead of its time even then and even though some people have sequel fatigue ten years of new horror content and the way society has shifted brings so much potential for scream 5 

i mean even in scream 4 the addition of modern at that point cell phones was new but with an even more intense social media boom in the last 10 years they have so much to work with along with all the new franchises and prestige horror over recent years including mainstream franchises like conjuring annabelle etc

i think they both have a lot to offer when it comes to storytelling and creating atmosphere there are some truly great scary things you can see or hear in either medium

but of the two i find video games to be much scarier because in order to experience the horror and progress you have to become an active participant whereas watching a movie is more passive in nature i also think that its much easier to immerse yourself in the horror atmosphere when you have the option to look around and explore the setting a bit on your own rather than following a camera guided by someone else and just being along for the ride further having control over where you go and what you look at and what you do comes with the added demand of keeping yourself alive within the game which i feel adds a layer to the horror any options you may have for comfort during a movie like looking away hiding behind somethingone etc may not be available to you while playing this also means that what you do can have consequences for the player character or other characters while characters in movies continue to play their role regardless of what you might be doing

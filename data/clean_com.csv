1,com,"I am a huge fan of pin head,Freddy,Jason,even mike Myers can't mess with  my dude,"
1,com,This was an entertaining movie... you definitely go for the fun and the gore of the kills than to be actually scared. It’s geared towards fans of comedy horror which I’m typically not... but I found it enjoyable to see who made it to the end.
1,com,Really enjoyed it

1,com,"  I will always say this movie is terrible, yet i have watched it at least 5 times in the past decade.  I will without a doubt watch it again, and be amazed at how bad it is.    despite thinking it it is a bad movie, i am entertained by it, and that is what movies are supposed to do. 
  so.. then is it bad after all?  I'm not sure. I will have to watch it again."
1,com,Couldn’t agree anymore!
1,com,It had its moments. There just wasn't enough of them. Most of the scenes that actually had Freddy vs Jason were good. Problem was there wasn't enough of them. It was still not a bad film though.
1,com,Not skinless

OK, Laddaland wasnt too bad, but Dark Flight? That was a shocker

So I recently picked up a bunch of bluray discs while on holiday, with this movie being one of them. I don't know why I expected it to be any good, but I did and joke is on me."

1,com,"I know horror movies get remade, recycled, and reimagined all the time, and unexpected sequels pop up frequently as well, but I'd say that the 2010s were especially rife with them.

Halloween, Blair Witch, Poltergeist, IT, The Grudge, Let Me In, Fright Night, Child's Play, The Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Black Christmas, The Silent House, Pet Sematary, Carrie, The Thing, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Mummy, Rings, Children of the Corn, The Crazies, The Wolfman, Piranha,  I Spit on Your Grave, Last House on the Left,  ... I could go on.

As for tropes, we have ""family trying to survive the apocalypse"" with movies like A Quiet Place, Bird Box, and It Comes At Night.

Then there's the ""wholesome thing turns out to be an evil cult"" trope with movies like Midsommar, The VVitch (sort of?), The Ritual, Apostle, The Shrine, The Babysitter, Get Out, Red State, Hereditary, Would You Rather,  The Void, Green Room, The sacrament, etc.

The ""posession/exorcism"" movie tropes in The Conjuring movies (and all their spin-offs), Insidious 1 and 2, The Last Exorcism, The Rite, The Possession, The Devil Inside, Ouija, The Devil's Candy (great, underrated movie, btw), Exorcismus, Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, Possession of Michael King, Possession of Hannah Grace, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Taking of Deborah Logan, Veronica, Grace, Hereditary... again, I could go on.

1,com,"id say that a common cliche nowadays is the fear of the unknown, and how almost no popular company nowadays is taking advantage of it.

(ill only be talking about shitty movies, but still, obligatory spoiler warning)

**example 1: absolutely everything is explained just before it happens**

 in the byebye man, the medium-psychic girl explains to the main character that the byebye man can cause auditory and visual hallucinations, in order to try and get yourself killed.&gt;! not a minute later, she 'sees' someone about to get hit by a train and jumps onto the tracks, killing her.!&lt; instead of having a 5 minute exposition dump, just showing her have the hallucination can clue the audience into figuring it out. we arent 3 year olds with no thought process, movie.

**example 2: the villains get 30 mins of exposition dumping**

this is the worst cheap mistake any story could do. for example, in most (bad) modern horror movies, everything gets a huge exposition dump. if you want the audience to fear your villain, DONT TELL US THEIR STRENGTHS AND WEAKESSES FIRST THING. in fact, it would be 100 times better if you just dont show us at all! Junji ito and his works (which arent garbage) are the most ridiculous yet terrifying thing (ex. huge balloons shaped like your head with a noose attached at the end, that try to kill you. yes, he made a comic about that and it was great), all because you dont know where they came from and dont know their intentions.

Another gripe i had was that some deaths just don't make much sense? Remember the car crash scene when Chucky disabled function on the seatbelts and airbag? Why would a car company think that was ok to *have* the option to disable those things?

Other than that stuff, i enjoyed it. The promo posters were funny and it was a pretty good movie all around."

(i know the whole series is uploaded to hdbest.net though, which can played on a laptop or airplayed to a TV with no issue)     

the *Evil Dead* franchise is also a personal favorite for me - the 2013 remake is fantastic, and it has some really cool stuff with a nail gun, a girl giving herself half a chelsea smile (lol), eye horror, chainsaw mutilation, literal blood rain... etc etc. i loved it!     

*Cabin Fever* and *Train To Busan* are also great, but unfortunately i think those may have been taken off?

Okay so its either spanish or french and a thriller:

Here is the plot:


A woman moves to an apartment to get over with a trauma caused by past incident where she was raped. As she started living alone in the apartment, one night she sees the same man who raped her in the streets from the window. She freaks out and decides never to go out. She ordered a lot of security stuff from online and put cameras everywhere in the house and different types of locks in every door and kept watching everything from camera. 

She then sees a girl soaked in blood moving inside her house from camera, but couldn't see in real. She saw blood too on the walls in the house from camera but it was not there in real. One day the rapist somehow entered her apartment and stabbed her while she was at bath but she manages to save herself by probably killing him, but with all those blood she ran everywhere in the house to escape and realized the girl soaked in blood she saw from cameras earlier was herself. 

She had the ability to get hints for whats gonna happen to her.

1,com,"true! it's absolutely iconic. i really liked the 2013 remake, too."
1,com,"you have a point here.      

i think horror isn't ""dying"" as much as it is evolving, but i'm not sure it's an evolution i'm 100% on board with either.     
i do tend to see more and more horror movies being advertised nowadays, as well as more public interest and acceptance; from my experience, loving horror used to be considered sort of a ""weird"" or ""oddball"" trait, but now it seems to be... in fashion?    

obviously, this yields positives and negatives, because on one hand, a lot of really talented indie horror directors are breaking through to the mainstream in a big way and releasing some amazing movies (ex. Jordan Peele and Ari Aster): on the other, every time i log onto netflix and see a new horror flick added i groan internally.     

there seems to be an influx of plots rooted in very boring psychological/paranormal concepts, and most of them end up feeling very palatable and ""fake deep"" to me - almost watered-down. i feel like people put too much pressure on horror to be intellectual as of late, and it truly does lose its impact... if i can watch a horror movie and never think about it again, then it clearly hasn't done it's job; next-to-none of these movies are ""franchiseable"", and i really doubt any of them reboot-worthy ten years from now.     

tl,dr; the game is a-changin'..."

1,com,"hmm that sounds very interesting! if what you say is true (which I believe you are XD) then i'll be looling forward to future horror flicks to! I also thought of going towards horror art to create anew original horror origins, etc. But it takes time and effort, which sometimes I don't have that motivational thoughts to do so despite being an artist. I wish we have a horror class here, but we don't unfortunantly. A horror film class sounds amazing in so many ways! A I'm an artist and interested in many fields even film. Have you heard of crypt tv on youtube? They have interesting horror flicks and some beautifuly done!"
1,com,"I actually think we’re entering (or already in) a horror renaissance right now. Robert Eggers (The VVITCH, The Lighthouse) is pretty new and doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. Ari Aster’s two horror flicks were also game changers imo, but I guess he’s said he doesn’t wanna make horror movies anymore. We’ve got kind of the tail end of Rob Zombie, more to be expected from Jordan Peele, and some really good indie artists making interesting horror flicks especially with A24. I’m taking a horror film class and read that historically, there’s been apparently a pattern with horror film Renaissances: they tend to start during war, social tension, and increases in poverty. I’d say we are kind of in a time where our tastes are darker than they used to be. I am not excited about much in the future, but I am looking forward to new terrifying and beautiful horror flicks. 😆"

In the scene I'm thinking of, it was definitely an old-timey scene of some type, I'm pretty sure Victorian era England, although I suppose it could have possibly been colonial America. Lots of elaborate formalwear. And I remember it was a Christmas dinner scene with decorations and I think someone was singing carols? There were 20-30 people in the scene, most of them at a very large table. 
In trying to find this particular roasted turkey resurrection scene, I've seen many. Its such a weird trope.

Yikes. To each their own I guess? 

I also don’t wanna assume you’ve never experienced sexual assault but lemme tell ya, being half conscious and unable to stop what’s happening to you is much more horrifying 🙃"

1,com,"I wouldn’t say banning it is the right way to go but it should come with an extremely strong warning label.

I’ve seen A Serbian Film several times, closer to ten ..? (Anyone reading this: just because I watched it doesn’t mean you should, seriously). I know whatever way I explain this it’s going to sound r/iamverybadass but I actually really genuinely enjoy that movie. I have a thing for shock factor, I like to amp it up as far as possible. And that movie has tiny shock factors all throughout that I have time to forget about and give me a spark each time I’ve seen it. I’ve shown it to several friends. To me the bad sexual assault scenes that would make me uncomfortable are ones where the victim is struggling against the assaulter. Or where the movie even feels real. That.. for reasons I wouldn’t like to get banned for spelling out.. didn’t happen in A Serbian Film. And it feels more like the worst drug trip **ever** than something plausible.

I missed the family part in OP’s post, definitely definitely not recommending then 😂"
1,com,"I’m against the concept of banning films usually but I make an exception with that film. 
The best review I read about it said “you think you want to see this movie but you really don’t.” And I really wish I had taken their advice. 

While it does horrify which technically would make it a horror movie, it seems to push boundaries with sexual assault to a point that seems extremely unnecessary. There was one shot in the whole movie that I would even consider art and it was the scene with the checkered floor (I’ve blocked most of the film out of my brain at this point) everything else felt like gratuitous shock value. It gave me PTSD for a few days/ weeks, if I’m being honest. And I can usually handle graphic sexual assault scenes.

Also op says their friends and FAMILY are gonna be attending so I can’t see that going well 😂"

1,com,"The issue I had with A quiet place, was that it had a lot of scenes which were ment to be scary and there was much less focus on the horror part of the story. I had somewhat of a hard time relating to the characters in the movie. One point that was brought out to me is what made that movie work for others is that they could actually relate to characters.

You say you dont scare easily either but the question is rather if this has always been the case?

Saying that you dont watch anything less than 5 is very fishy strategy. Essentially this has been my strategy too and it causes me some distress at times because I might miss out on some great movies. The strategy I have adopted is to follow the reviews of some established players that have voted on past movies the way I have. So if the average of a movie is 3...but dude has voted 8 then there is a good chance I would too."
1,com,"Interesting ideas. I'm female and love horror movies but I don't scare easily either. A quiet place was good, but not scary. The most scary movies in my opinion are the ones that could actually happen in real life. I've seen some real disturbing movies which may fall into that category as well. Out of a 10 rating, I won't watch anything less than a 5, which only tells me the movie is watchable, nothing more."

1,com,"Films (and horror films in particular) are amazing in their ability to develop archetypes through unique fictional characters. In the more layered, symbolism-laden movies/stories, each character represents a certain ideal, or certain values, positive or negative, that tap into the collective imagination of the viewer. And that's where the audience is being drawn in, the recognition of those 'archetypes', those symbols representing real life values, and forces."

1,com,"Hey man, if you haven't already heard, do not miss ""Train to Busan""! Seriously, I don't know what the budget was for it, to me it really puts to shame tons of infected/zombie movies made here in America! To tell you the truth, I mostly bypass most movies that are about zombies these days! I'm pretty sick of the trash that's being put out on a constant basis about zombies! I have pretty good access to even obscure movies so trust me when I tell you that there are more of them than most people know! Tons of trash! Anyway, the name of ""Train to Busan"" kept coming up everywhere I was checking movie reviews. I always check out flicks that have good word of mouth, I use IMDB all the time also but many users reviews are biased with agendas. When I finally saw it, I was very surprised at how good, well acted, and action packed it was! That's why I never discriminate when it comes to movies! I watch movies from all countries as much as I can! I have found some great ones from places that I never thought even were into movies. Anyway, enjoy!"

But years later I had a nightmare I’ve still never forgotten which blended the woods from the Blair witch project, surrounded by movie aisles from Blockbuster. With the Well in the middle of the aisles in the woods, then she came for me. The movie was creepy but didn’t scare me too much. But the dream made me not like that movie anymore.

The later ones are a bit silly and nowhere near as polished as the first but thus is the way of horror series. 

In another 10-20 years, people will still look back on this series as a ""classic"". It's solid, memorable, wacky, gory, and the first few really solidified a genre and brought it to mainstream (for the first time in my life I have encountered kids who don't know who Freddy is but know who Jigsaw is)."

Second place would have to be Blair Witch 1 and 2. There's something inherent about being lost in the woods with an evil presence that terrified me all the way through. 

Scariest scare I ever had was that scene in Hereditary in the beginning after the funeral. There was no noise and you can miss it if you're not paying attention, but it caught me so off guard and so early on, I'll never forget it."

Of course the latter films aren't as good and almost seem silly, but when you get that many sequels, where else is there to go? Jason and Freddy did the same. Anything else that comes later will do it too."
0,com,"Hatchet 2006, if he likes F13 he might also like this one. Its basically F13 but much much more gory but in a ridiculous way.

Phantasm series is also good because of how weird it is.

Behind the mask: the rise of leslie vernon is a great meta slasher. Its not meta like scream, instead its meta because of the character of Leslie Vernon who exists in a world where slashers (like freddy, jason and michael) exist.

Final destination series is also great. I watched them as a kid."
0,com,most recently? i would say lake mungo.

4-Spaced Invaders - not a horror but a fun 90s movie about aliens that land on Halloween &amp; think

\-Return to Oz- a movie many kids will tell  you that still haunts their dreams

\-The 2 Goosebumps movies

\-All the versions of The Addams Family Movies, including the new cartoon version. Not horror but still fun.

\-Same for Beetlejuice, fun but not horror.

Maybe show him some old stuff too like the classic Universal Monsters &amp; then the Hammer remakes."

I think it's in a different league than most studio films, Eggers is a former production designer, the way he immerses viewers into his stories, particularly the matter-of-fact approach with The Witch is what did it for me. It's a really simple story aided by masters of their craft in their respective departments. 

If you're not big into the arthouse horror genre, I get it."

0,com,"All Hallows’ eve. It’s the ending, the phone call part. If you know you know. The most disturbing films I’ve watched weren’t horrors though: it’s a tie between ‘Seven’ and ‘All Good Things’ starring Ryan gosling. Latter is probably worse as it’s based on a true story (but seven is a great film.) Robert Durst is suspected of having killed lots of people, including a woman who went missing near his shop and I won’t say who else because that’s shown in the film. Ryan portrayal of Durst unsettled me for days. Just empty, devoid. Usually things like that don’t get to me but it made me feel physically sick"

It felt like he knew he wanted out of the relationship (which, like most toxic relationships, was unhealthy for both of them to different degrees), but wasn't sure when he could break up with her. Should he have done it right after her sister's murder-suicide? I think she should have broken up with him then, but for him to be the one to break up then would have been potentially really harmful. So instead he continues to go through the motions, unable to truly be passionate towards her because he just does not have passion for her anymore. He'd let it reach a ""no-win"" point by the time Dani's sister died but didn't know how to accept the loss."

The director is quoted as saying:

""The goal with “It Follows” was to be very deliberate — make specific choices, and really try to craft everything from the camerawork to the editing, the sound design, the music. It was about being specific.""

There's not a lot of substance to it. I have never said the third act is ""such a catastrophe"". That's a strawman.

It's also why I don't get too pressed about the 'is Silence of the Lambs a horror movie or a thriller movie' argument: there's a lot of intersectionality between thrillers and specifically slashers, and while Silence is definitely not a slasher, it's definitely got characters that fit horror archetypes, and in context, both Hannibal and Wild Bill would be slasher villains if the narrative focused more on them. It can easily fill both roles, similar to Psycho or a film like Se7en.

In my mind, a *lot* of murder thrillers are basically slashers that focus less on the killer and far more heavily on somebody in willful pursuit of the killer. To me, Psycho is the cement that laid the foundation for slashers, Halloween was what was built on that foundation once the cement dried"

0,com," 

I only watched this movie for the first time recently. I was under the impression it was some sort of slapstick comedy involving spiders. I was pleasantly surprised. This was a real blast. It felt like it was trying to combine the tones of Gremlins and Jaws, and it succeeded quite admirably. There's some true terror and suspense here and first time director Frank Marshall does a good job with the buildup, letting us get to know the town and characters before all hell breaks loose. The film has strong production values with Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy (!) producing and Frank Marshall who produced several classics with them and was a 2nd unit director on films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Back to the Future, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. We have Spielberg's normal editor Michael Kahn working on the film, great cinematography by Mikael Salomon (The Abyss) and a great score by Trevor Jones (Cliffhanger, The Last of the Mohicans, Labyrinth) and animatronic effects by Chris Walas (Gremlins, The Fly) . Jeff Daniels is also a great everyman lead and he has great support from John Goodman and Julian Sands. This is basically a B movie with an A list budget and crew. How many horror movies, especially creature features, today would take the time and money to go and film a 15 minute prologue in Venezuela complete with sweeping helicopter shots? This movie has kind of been lost in the shuffle when it comes to films in the Amblin catalog of the time and it did OK but not great business when it came out but I'd say this deserves to be just as fondly remembered as those other films. There are have been talks of a remake of Arachnophobia but I'd say it won't be as good. Especially since they no doubt will use CGI spiders instead of the mix of real and animatronic ones this movie used and there is no doubt it won't look as good

Fun facts

\-the spider on the poster was removed from the VHS and DVD covers for some reason. They put it back on the Blu ray covers

\-the trailers and TV spots marketed the movie more as a wacky comedy. Featuring John Goodman's character heavily, even though he actually has an extended cameo. They also used the term ""Thrillomedy"" to describe it, something that hasn't really been used again

\-When Jeff Daniels came on board to play Dr. Ross Jennings, the film was a serious horror movie, one that Daniels told Philadelphia's ""Daily News"" was pretty formulaic"" ""You could tell that the lines were kind of written by computer,"" he said. He and Frank Marshall were hoping for a more ironic tone, so the script went through several revisions, and the filmmakers studied Alfred Hitchcock films and Jaws (1975) to get the tone right. One key change: Daniels' character was given a fear of spiders."

I think the opinions the films and directors you're mentioning are pretty mixed. This thread is evidence of it. I don't know what ""factual"" evidence you can use to say these directors aren't effective or good or original. This goes back to my original point: disagreeing with someone who says a movie is objectively well made is fine, but disagreeing by saying the are objectively poorly made is just the same thing.

Again, I love Hitchcock, but you're giving him a lot of credit for things that are either questionable or debated. Figures in the movements you mention certainly admired Hitchcock, but where is the influence on films of the French New Wave? I mean, Truffaut loved Hitchcock but their films could scarcely be more different. I think you make a better case him being diverse, which is obviously valuable in its own way. And this raises questions about originality itself - Hitchcock didn't write any of these movies, so should claims of originality be associated with him specifically? I don't think having a distinct style - which is what I think Hitchcockian means - is the same as being original."

I have absolutely no doubt in my mind (as a solicitor for 2 back in 2008) that any good quality legal individual/team would tell this woman to go to the police, rather than milk her for legal aid. There’s three situations when you need a solicitor before the police, they are: legal aid (has a crime been committed, you’re not sure), involvement (you have committed a crime) and civil matters (some kind of disagreement usually between close parties).

If there’s an obvious crime which you’re a victim of and it’s not something small like “my husbands using my password to open a bank account”,  police before lawyer - always.

Gonna end this discussion because we’re kind of deviating onto the same point ultimately which is “tell someone professional” (be it police or legal)."

They do not investigate these statements if there is no lead. As someone who has been the victim, a witness, and is a mandatory reporter, I'm just letting you know that I've been told multiple times that there isn't any way they can question the abuser based on how little or how old the events were, but they would file it away for the next person.

As for child abuse, if a case of child abuse is reported, no matter how small, legally they must investigate. Legally, CPS must go to the home and do a wellness check. Sexual abuse victims do not have the same rights. Sexual abuse victims just prove fault, not prove innocence, as with a child abuse case.

Very few of these guys get arrested. As I've said before, talking to a lawyer first is the best bet. There are plenty of pro bono sexual abuse lawyers in all states who can at least answer emails. 

I never said she should do nothing and I certainly am not sitting on a moral high ground. I have been a victim, a witness, and am now a mandatory reporter. I have worked with rape victims and DFCS at a substance abuse shelter. This is not a moral high ground, this is just from experience: talk to a lawyer to see how this may play out, but don't expect much to come from it."

The government being completely fucking incompetent in handling Godzilla is an amazing comment/critique the first time you watch the movie, but it feels like a complete slog on rewatches.

The way they end up defeating Godzilla feels too silly when compared to the rest of the movie.

I think not reporting rape due to having no evidence is the worst possible advice for victims of sexual assault and I can’t see how you can sit on a moral high ground and recommend she does nothing. If you genuinely think someone who’s been sexually abused or manipulated is better of sitting at home and putting it on Facebook because they’re worried there isn’t enough evidence to get a conviction, you’re either a terrible person or a terrible judge of morality.

If you do not have hard evidence, the police will file away what you said and no action will come of it. Later, should another victim come to light, that victim's lawyer will need to request a copy of your statement (or you request it to give it to them) and it may be used in the other case in conjunction with other testimonies as a way of showing a history of predatory patterns. However, if there was no outright sexual coersion or abuse, your statement will do little to nothing to assist in bringing him to justice. 

By giving a statement to police (which I am unsure if you've done but it's very triggering and the cops asking you questions may be assholes that doubt you), you may well just be wasting your time. This is not a stolen wallet. Her statement is, in no way, evidence. Because there is no physical proof (like a stolen wallet) if wrongdoing.

It's not about squeezing a long book into an hour or so movie. When making a movie, scenes from the book are bound to get chopped off, and that's fine. Not all scenes from a book make sense in a movie.

It doesn’t surprise me to hear these things about him because he seems like a giant piece of shit, but I would definitely get this story out there.

&gt;Do you think that films that are a bit more “high-brow” like Romero’s Dawn of The Dead and Carpenters The Thing count?

I would definitely qualify those as Splatter, and would actually say a large chunk of cosmic/body horror qualifies i.e. The Void, Hellraiser, etc. 

I also agree with your notion that Splatter can cross multiple genres. I’d qualify some of my favorite none-horror films as Splatter

I believe we're going to see an increase in films about secret government conspiracies / distrust of authorities / misplaced trust in organizations working against our best interests, probably in a sci-fi or action context. However when we see these films might depend on who's in office after the election. 

I would absolutely love to see a return of the Action Science Hero character, very prominent in the '40s and '50s with a brief resurgence in kids' cartoons in the '70s. An educated scientist willing and able to step into the action and save lives directly. I'm certain this is a prominent fantasy for doctors, nurses, scientists, and everyone else intimately involved with the current pandemic.

0,com,"Love this movie-- it might actually BE about as close to a ""favorite"" movie as I could claim to have without really having one-- I didn't like the overall original story AS much-- but it DID have kind of this echoey spookiness in it's whole tone that I LOVED and was sorely missing from the film-- and it needed to add in a few of the scenes from the story as well. Especially one in particular: the story doesn't deal in Limbos, it tells you they went to Hell the first time and were granted some sort of pass in striking a deal-- the opportunity to live again if they could take out Jim for whatever reason. So the scene is that Jim is ready to cut the shit-- he knows they are who they look like, he can guess what they want-- so he ""holds one of them after class"" for a few minutes, and they feel each other out and talk fighting terms. Jim asks him, already kind of seeming to guess but testing his reaction; ""Where were  you? You know... Before. The kid tightens up and actually looks scared and goes; ""Hey, we ain't talkin' about THAT!"" Then as he's leaving, Jim tells him point blank that he's gonna kill him when they meet again. The kid kinda looks back and goes ""Thought you knew, daddio-- I'm already dead."" 

The overall tone, this scene, and a couple of other minor tweaks-- the movie would've been nearly perfect. 

Oh, also in the story-- it leads you to think it means-- as it DOES mean in the movie-- that sometimes just ""the dead"" come back. Only at the end of the story, after he's made his deal and been presently compensated, he thinks he hears footsteps behind him that sound more like hooves, and he wonders to himself if he truly made the right decision... If sometimes our PROBLEMS aren't doomed to ""come back"" in one form or another no matter what."

0,com,"Yeah i remember when i played The Evil Within 2 for the first time, it felt different than watching a movie. When you watch a movie you get attached to the characters but it's nearly impossible to put yourself in their place, mostly due to the fact that you're not in control of what's happening to the characters, and sometimes they'll make some decisions that'll make you wish their death even more.

When it came to this game though, i was so immersed that it almost felt like i was the one walking around Union, peeking on corners trying not to be seen by monsters so i could stab them in the back, realizing they're not dead and yeeting myself out of there while being heard by other enemies, swearing in every language that came to mind until eventually losing them with only a chunk of life left.

It was horrifying, especially the bosses, and the town hall... i had to pause at least 2 times during that chapter."

1. Sometimes scenes will be shot specifically for trailers/tv spots or will simply just be left on the cutting room floor (deleted scenes). Don’t worry, you’re not losing your mind! Haha. 

2. More than like the final act’s Invisible Man was Adrian’s brother the whole time. So they had likely set up Adrian’s “kidnapping” beforehand. Second, Adrian wanted Cecilia to look as crazy as possible but moreover, he wanted her to *feel* crazy. If he was “kidnapped” then she technically cannot put any of the blame on him, making her question her reality and as to who was really behind the mask. It’s also a way for him to escape persecution from the law.

Hope this helps!"
0,com,"I agree with you. However, I feel like the horror lessens after a while when you figure out how the enemies work.

Funnilly enough, the scariest games for me are point and click games like ""Oxenfree"" or ""Detention"".

It was probably partly she was a woman as well since they make references to sexist discrimination still being a thing. (mistaken for a man joke, surprised Ripley can handle the loader)

Why did they put a colony on LV-426 in the first place? Ask Weyland-Yutani. They knew about the xenos already.

The ""rescue"" mission never was intended to be one, W-Y simply wanted to know what happened with the xenos and the settlers.
So it was never a question to go down there, the only question was, would W-Y finally get their hands on a xenomorph and be able to transport it to earth, in the bellies of a few marines, and maybe even get rid of ripley, who knew a lot of the dirty W-Y secrets."

Caught this last night, thought it was quite unique. Definitely not for everyone, as most of it is slow, uneventful and after its first 25 funny and relatable minutes, it is *very* vague. I liked this about it though, and I'm typically a person who looks for near-complete clarity in books and movies. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the way they used sound in this. 

There were one or two scenes that genuinely scared me, which is definitely a plus. I feel like this is one of those films that you'll either love or hate. The runtime is only 80 minutes, so I say it's worth a shot.

0,com,"I've talked  about it in other posts but I'll be making an actual review at some point. I've been busy so that full post might not come for awhile but here’s the unfinished version:

I thought it was fucking amazing. Firstly the decision to dump the Saeki’s story in order to tell a new one that has similar themes was much needed as the original plot has been explored from every possible angle IMO. Secondly I love how unapologetically brutal Origins is as it sets it apart from others in the series that prefer to have their violence off screen. I also appreciate the return of the weird time warp shit from “Juon: The Grudge”. The only things I don’t really like about the show are the whole “based on a true story” thing, that bit about the face being twisted in fear they stole from Ring, and the lack of the usual opening text. Other then that I have some smaller issues like the pacing not always being perfect, especially between episodes, and some of the subtitles feeling a tiny bit clunky in some spots. 

**Final verdict**

Solid 8/10. This is on par with the original films for sure. I'm super glad I got into the series right before Origins was announced. 

Writing this out actually brought me closer to my actual review so thanks."

He was so kooky and oddly likable in the beginning. Maybe it's because I'm kind of a weirdo too, but I found the entire family unit kind of likable and I liked that they all have their character flaws but still love each other. I thought the whole cast did a good job. I think Joely Richardson did an effective job in her scenes early on and I would've liked maybe a little more with her and Cage at the beginning is my only nitpick. The visuals and mood is outstanding and I thought the movie did an excellent job balancing humor with the first half having some hilarious moments contrasted to the third act which is very grim and unsettling. There's one image I will definitely not forget. Great movie and I'm so glad Richard Stanley is back directing again."

0,com,"I kind of disagree that the family should have been less weird from the start. One thing I liked is that the color just amplified the dysfunctional family dynamics that were already there. Cage's character worries he is becoming like his father and then takes on his father's voice, persona, and bad behavior (drinking, abuse). The older son is a slacker who wastes his time, then literally starts losing large chunks of time. The younger son is too clingy and dependent on his mother, then gets resorbed by her. The mother sees herself as undesirable and then becomes a literal hideous monster. The daughter is into weird occult stuff and then carves runes into her body. All the problems were there under the surface, the color just brought them out and, in many cases, made them literal."

0,com,"Wow, there is honestly no need for that hostility. I posted bc i wanted to “feel out” how people felt about it. I have never been to anything like this nor my friend that keeps pushing me to still go with her. Due to my work schedule and a family event (that i dont even want to attend) we were only going to be able to go for friday evening. Bc of what is going on i was only interested in meeting Skeet Ulrich, and getting an autograph. For her, brad dourif. So i was asking about how stuff like that works, to see if it’s something I’m still willing to do, and feel safe. I’m not running around loose with a MAGA hat saying my civil liberties are being fucked with. I always wear a mask if I’m at work, the grocery store, or picking up food... bc those are the only places i have been since before this happened. I havent went to a retail store to go shopping. I have not went to a restaurant to eat since January. I have not spent any time with anyone besides my parents that I live with since January. Ive been asked to go on dates by a few people and have refused all. I make sure that i protect others by wearing my mask. I wear rubber gloves that i keep in my car most of the time going inside places as well. 

I say since before covid happened bc i typically don’t go anywhere but work... which with my hour commute both ways, my super long shifts, and getting ready for work and shower after i only have 6-8 hours before i have to wake up to do it again. On my days off I’m usually in my room doing nothing bc I generally only feel safe there when my anxiety is high. Now I did not have access to health care for 11 crucial years in my life, and i utilize my health coverage pretty damn well. I have bipolar disorder and treat it with my meds that are balanced out, as well as psych and a talk therapist. My therapist thought this would be a great place for me to finally do something “social” that still makes me feel IN my comfort zone, while doing something new. We decided that before covid started, but after we have been playing it by ear. 

I didnt need to explain myself to someone who just assumed i was being some run of the mill Indiana Trump supporter that thinks “covid is a scam”... you have no idea how much conversation has been had about if i should go or not between my friends, my parents, and my doctor. 

This was something my therapist and i thought of as a way for me to get out of an antisocial behavior rut, while being in my comfort zone, and surrounded by things i enjoy. Everyone is experiencing this pandemic differently. Some of our lives have been affected drastically, and some very little. I was off work for two months, and ive been back for two months. I was terrified to return to work and am still pretty scared being there. I have been checking online, seeing how the event is handling covid safety, But wasnt sure (still am not, but most likely won’t go) how the events usually go. I just wanted to ask a few things to anyone who knew on this sub so I could have all information needed before I made my decision. 

I doubt you read all this, but seriously... consider being a little nicer to people when you know literally nothing about them."

The 90s one had a ton of great actors at the time and they were great, but their parts just weren't very cohesive to me and the ending was just dumb.

Then comes the part 2 of the remake.  And... same.  Great lineup of actors for the adults, same lack of cohesiveness that brings the story together.  And that ending...  I'll take the spider over that second ending any day of the week.  It was terrible."

0,com,"How is supporting an institution while being safe controversial?  I don't think it is.  People who are totally dismissive of the best way to view a movie and who seem to want it to go away is what is controversial.

I totally reject both the idea of a movie premiering at home and then theaters or at the same time because it's ankling theaters.  In fact I think the home window should be lengthened to six months plus like it was years ago.  If theaters (hopefully just in the short term) are showing fewer movies in fewer auditoriums, they'll hopefully have to lengthen the time they have them to allow people to trickle in, so the home window has to be extended.

You should check your local (regular indoor) theaters to find out if any are open and showing classic movies.  Cinemark was going to open last week and show a bunch of classics; I'm not sure if that's still the plan when they do.  Out of the five times I went recently, three were old movies including *Superman* (1978) which I had never viewed in a theater.  It was great!  *The Empire Strikes Back* is showing at a single screen theater starting yesterday."

No idea how that cabin and the dream of the rotting corpse ties into this."
0,com,"Honestly, it was so metaphor heavy it reminded me way more of Mother! (not necessarily a bad thing) than any of the films you mentioned. I'm also struggling to see the connections with the films you've mentioned, as the themes have already been done by films that predate the ones you've mentioned.  The labyrinth, creepy cabin, mental illness/grief and self-harm all done many times before.

I absolutely agree about the direction of the film being inconsistent, but the character development wasn't needed, it just would have added to the drama and taken even more away from the horror aspect. I think that's because as you mentioned "" The ""horror"" aspect of this film couldn't handle the weight of the actual subject Alzheimer's &amp; its destructive, traumatic legacy"". It bordered a drama more than a horror.

Personally I didn't mind the ending, the tone was a bit off compared to the rest of the movie but overall not terrible. Lol at cinematic surround sound version of scab picking hahaha. Also hope my post didn't come off as cunty, am not trying to be at all.

There should be no reason that local theaters cannot do the same thing.  There is a long long list of films I would pay to see in the theater.  This would keep them thriving in this situation we are in.

Also, Trolls: World Tour was supposed to be a theatrical release.  It was released online and made much more than the projected theater earnings.  As a person with a family of 6, I have to pay a small fortune to take the kids out to see a film.  $10 to $15 a ticket, popcorn and drinks and all that.  Now, I can rent the film for $20 to $25 and have drinks and popcorn from the grocery store.  I bet more families are jumping at that chance.

That being said, I agree with you that films made like that should be fully experienced in the theater.  But, maybe compromise?  Once things die down, make a theatrical rerelease for those that WANT that experience with a genuinely good film."
0,com,I started watching it for the second time last month and currently in the first half of season 2. It's very similar to X-Files but is more story focused.

As far as the disparity in film styles (mainstream vs. arthouse I suppose is an apt way to look at it), I think that a lot of this is tied to people's perception of mainstream releases representing the genre.  While I enjoyed both those films a lot in their own ways, it's just a given that films like **Insidious** are going to see wider releases, and more success with the general populace.  I don't think there is any shortage of stranger films though; finding them just requires more work.

Okay, I've watched it four times and again with the writer/director's commentary. Please do watch it again, and everything will be very clear to you."

And it was confirmed in her contract that she would come back in Scream 5 or could, so also with her show Nashville not being on the air and this movie looking to be big with horror franchises coming back hard, I can definitely see her coming back.  Even if she's a Randy figure who gets killeld in her second appearance"

0,com,"It wasn't exactly a bad idea; they just weren't comfortable with it. I wouldn't be either. 

But Frankenstein Must be Destroyed is the one where he is really an evil son of a bitch. He does a bunch of evil shit in Curse...for sure, but he's just so mean and nasty in ...Destroyed that the rape fits. And compared to stuff today it is very tame, but still disturbing as hell. Without showing any explicit content at all. There is a documentary on Amazon prime called Monster Madness where Veronica Carlson talks about it. It's part 3 of a series. Interview was filmed at one of the last Fanex conventions. It's pretty cool."

0,com,"I appreciate the effort and read through it but I disagree with almost every point. 

To be completely honest, I watched it a while ago so don't remember everything but I believe there was a moment with a gunshot that is meant to be that twist ""reveal."" They do try and obfuscate the fact that they are the same person. They have two different actresses solely for the superficial tension added with the family that picks up Emma Roberts. If we knew outright it was the same person the whole last part of the movie would lose any impact. The whole giggling in the bathroom scene wouldn't need to happen. It was a deliberate choice to mislead the audience, but in no way was it earned. 

Either way, there are definitely moments that are meant to ""reveal"" the reality that they're the same person. Why need those if they're not trying to hide it? Maybe ""twist"" is the wrong wording, but they were trying to hide it and the only reason it works is because they used an entirely different person. 

All that said, I'll try and rewatch it soon based on what you're saying."

I did hear one big rumor: that potentially the plot is that the people who made Stab are \*rebooting\* Stab the franchise with new younger actors replacing the OG actors who played Sidney, Gale, Dewey (who all died in Scream 3 lol). 

So it would focus on the actors filming a Stab reboot, but the twist would be that the OGs wouludn't know who is actually in danger from Ghostface, both themselves and the actors playiing them, since the Stab reboot would change the outcome of the original Stab."

Since episodes filmed and aired so close together, they were having to master their songs and choreography within days. I remember reading some huge red flag interview when they went on tour after season 2 where they were all like, ""yeah, I don't remember the last time I wasn't at work or got to sleep, but it's fine because I'm doing it with my friends."" Pair that with the overnight stardom they all experienced, and it's almost a miracle it isn't worse."

0,com,"Info dump here on a lot of random things:

Originally, years ago, *Scream 5* was supposed to be a direct follow up to its predecessor.  Jill would survive, with part of the story centered around her trial and how justice wasn't exactly being served with differing accounts of what happened, her playing up post-traumatic stress, and the insanity plea.  Kirby would survive into this film, alongside Judy Hicks. It was highly speculated but never confirmed that Judy would be a Ghostface here.  Little details known aside from this.

A few years ago, *Scream 5* was being pitched as a new jumping on point.  I don't know that they planned to bring anyone from the earlier films back.  The idea was that there would be a reality show based off of the Stab films where of course things go wrong. The idea got canned, but not before the idea of making it more meta came up- switching it to be set in the real world about the *Scream* series instead of stab, meaning all actors could return.

As of now, neither of the above are the central plot of *Scream 5*.  The only major plot detail is that after moving away from her hometown, a girl returns after her parents are murdered.  Many believe this is Kirby.  Some have theorized that it is a previously unmentioned child of Gale and Dewey.  Since ""parents"" are murdered, either Dewey could be dead or a ""step-dad"" could be.  It sounds like in any case, they want another run of *Scream* movies, and plan to intentionally leave this one on a cliffhanger of some sort."

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Love this one.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I am a huge fan of pin head,Freddy,Jason,even mike Myers can't mess with  my dude,"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,This was an entertaining movie... you definitely go for the fun and the gore of the kills than to be actually scared. It‚Äôs geared towards fans of comedy horror which I‚Äôm typically not... but I found it enjoyable to see who made it to the end.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Really enjoyed it
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I actually found it quite entertaining and I've seen a lot of horror movies, but this one definitely had a comical side to it."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I respect that probably more a thriller! 
Yeh it‚Äôs definitely a weird one"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I don‚Äôt consider it horror, but it was ok, not my favorite."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I‚Äôve seen them both. The Lighthouse is outstanding and a beautiful film, but The Witch is one of my favorite films of all time. If you haven‚Äôt seen The Lighthouse I highly recommend it."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I know right? The Light House is supposed to be even better.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I honestly feel the same and I don‚Äôt know why!
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Thank you everyone üíì
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,It doesn't but it might
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Thank you! Im so glad you liked it! Id love for you to subscribe to see whatbI have instore for the future :)
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,One of the best movies I‚Äôve ever seen
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"That story doesn‚Äôt exist though, but hey why not?"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,This was amazing
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Any good?
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I like your dolls
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Haven‚Äôt seen this one, vaguely remember hearing about it. Any good?"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Loved it!
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"  I will always say this movie is terrible, yet i have watched it at least 5 times in the past decade.  I will without a doubt watch it again, and be amazed at how bad it is.    despite thinking it it is a bad movie, i am entertained by it, and that is what movies are supposed to do. 
  so.. then is it bad after all?  I'm not sure. I will have to watch it again."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Couldn‚Äôt agree anymore!
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,It had its moments. There just wasn't enough of them. Most of the scenes that actually had Freddy vs Jason were good. Problem was there wasn't enough of them. It was still not a bad film though.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Not skinless
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I assume u keep a skinless sex fiend in the bedroom then
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I LOVED this movie and it took me until 2018 to finally watch it. Such an awesome movie!!
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,That‚Äôs a tough one I think I‚Äôd go with hereditary
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Nah the issue is the message itself too. They literally shoehorn misandrist comments every 5 minutes of this shit film. And then they wonder why people hate feminism now.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,One of my favorite movies.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Best film ever.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I've always had a love/hate relationship with Thai horrors - sometimes they are really good, like Shutter, but most of the time they are really bad, like Laddaland or Dark Flight.

OK, Laddaland wasnt too bad, but Dark Flight? That was a shocker

So I recently picked up a bunch of bluray discs while on holiday, with this movie being one of them. I don't know why I expected it to be any good, but I did and joke is on me."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,*find
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Nope, but this looks fun too :)"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"The Ritual, Apostle, The Devil's Candy, Would You Rather (I know some people hate this movie but I thought it was great), Last Train to Busan."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I think there is a tragic lack of subtlety in movies lately anyway, so it stands to reason that a movie that sets out to make a point would end up bashing people over the head with it instead of seamlessly merging it with the plot."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I know horror movies get remade, recycled, and reimagined all the time, and unexpected sequels pop up frequently as well, but I'd say that the 2010s were especially rife with them.

Halloween, Blair Witch, Poltergeist, IT, The Grudge, Let Me In, Fright Night, Child's Play, The Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Black Christmas, The Silent House, Pet Sematary, Carrie, The Thing, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Mummy, Rings, Children of the Corn, The Crazies, The Wolfman, Piranha,  I Spit on Your Grave, Last House on the Left,  ... I could go on.

As for tropes, we have ""family trying to survive the apocalypse"" with movies like A Quiet Place, Bird Box, and It Comes At Night.

Then there's the ""wholesome thing turns out to be an evil cult"" trope with movies like Midsommar, The VVitch (sort of?), The Ritual, Apostle, The Shrine, The Babysitter, Get Out, Red State, Hereditary, Would You Rather,  The Void, Green Room, The sacrament, etc.

The ""posession/exorcism"" movie tropes in The Conjuring movies (and all their spin-offs), Insidious 1 and 2, The Last Exorcism, The Rite, The Possession, The Devil Inside, Ouija, The Devil's Candy (great, underrated movie, btw), Exorcismus, Paranormal Activity 1 and 2, Possession of Michael King, Possession of Hannah Grace, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Taking of Deborah Logan, Veronica, Grace, Hereditary... again, I could go on.

&amp;#x200B;

That's about all I can think of specifically from the 2010s."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I 100% agree that too much is spelled out for the audience. Nothing is left for us to figure out, or even just ponder over. Some of the most memorable horror movies are the ones that left the audience speculating. People still debate over the end of The Thing (1982) and whether passing the ""whiskey"" bottle was a test or not."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"This is a bit of a stretch, but that sort of reminds me of Hard Ticket to Hawaii, which was not a horror film, but was pretty gory and used a lot of common '80s horror special effects.

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Yeah that was pretty bizarre lol when sense Jason had the time to that ? He's always about the killing.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Didn't watch Naked Vengeance on that blu-ray just Vendetta mostly lately.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I enjoyed it, the only thing that annoyed me was Jason keeping a hostage."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"That has more of a plot... Here's it's just 3 girls drinking, driving having sex and then dying at the end that's it. No plot points at all. You don't even know about the characters. At least in Megan you did know about her."

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"id say that a common cliche nowadays is the fear of the unknown, and how almost no popular company nowadays is taking advantage of it.

(ill only be talking about shitty movies, but still, obligatory spoiler warning)

**example 1: absolutely everything is explained just before it happens**

 in the byebye man, the medium-psychic girl explains to the main character that the byebye man can cause auditory and visual hallucinations, in order to try and get yourself killed.&gt;! not a minute later, she 'sees' someone about to get hit by a train and jumps onto the tracks, killing her.!&lt; instead of having a 5 minute exposition dump, just showing her have the hallucination can clue the audience into figuring it out. we arent 3 year olds with no thought process, movie.

**example 2: the villains get 30 mins of exposition dumping**

this is the worst cheap mistake any story could do. for example, in most (bad) modern horror movies, everything gets a huge exposition dump. if you want the audience to fear your villain, DONT TELL US THEIR STRENGTHS AND WEAKESSES FIRST THING. in fact, it would be 100 times better if you just dont show us at all! Junji ito and his works (which arent garbage) are the most ridiculous yet terrifying thing (ex. huge balloons shaped like your head with a noose attached at the end, that try to kill you. yes, he made a comic about that and it was great), all because you dont know where they came from and dont know their intentions.

its like 1 AM for me so those are all i can think of atm. anyways, good luck with your study!"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"oh, awesome! have fun!"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I just found a trailer of it thank u so much
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Omg I think this was it
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,This is one of the rare films we‚Äôre I prefer the remake. Definitely a must watch though.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"the closest one i can think of is *Silent Scream* (2005) - also known as *The Retreat*!     
it does have college students, a cabin in the woods during winter, a demented professor, tons of murder and an ‚Äúit was all a dream‚Äù ending ... but no bear traps or soccer cleats, as far as i can remember.      

hmm. i love finding ‚Äúlost movies‚Äù for people, but this one has really thrown me for a loop!"

  Ireland has been making some good ones for a bit now.   another good comedy/scifi/horror ish.. one was grabbers.  
   I think there was one maybe called the Honeymoon?   was that Irish?  the one i'm thinking of is a werewolf movie"

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Oh this looks good.  Bill is the man!
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,The Hallow (2015) nice little Irish creature feature that is very underrated imo
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,That Dracula movie with Johnny Lee Miller is low key one of my guilty pleasure horror flicks.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"i really feel like you have to be a Jim Jarmusch fan for this one.   I really liked it, but i have loved everything of his that iv'e seen.    Definitely not a ""horror"" movie.  More of a self aware/deadpan/black comedy set to a zombie theme."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,night of the creeps?
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Martyrs! The French version of course
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,High Tension and Hereditary
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Any 80s horrors. Lost boys, evil dead 2, fright night, reanimator, the stuff... I could go on"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I both liked it and hated it. The design of the doll was good, but by stripping Chucky's ""this doll is possessed by someone!"" Scheme and replacing it with, ""this doll has malfunctioning code!"" It essentially drains the entire dolls personality and makes it a boring, flat object.

Another gripe i had was that some deaths just don't make much sense? Remember the car crash scene when Chucky disabled function on the seatbelts and airbag? Why would a car company think that was ok to *have* the option to disable those things?

Other than that stuff, i enjoyed it. The promo posters were funny and it was a pretty good movie all around."

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"If Terrifier is still on Netflix, that‚Äôll do the trick."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Thank you
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"i‚Äôm not in the states which means i get somewhat different stuff on netflix, but if you can find any of the *Saw* movies, those are always good and generally quite gory - especially 3 and 6.    
(i know the whole series is uploaded to hdbest.net though, which can played on a laptop or airplayed to a TV with no issue)     

the *Evil Dead* franchise is also a personal favorite for me - the 2013 remake is fantastic, and it has some really cool stuff with a nail gun, a girl giving herself half a chelsea smile (lol), eye horror, chainsaw mutilation, literal blood rain... etc etc. i loved it!     

*Cabin Fever* and *Train To Busan* are also great, but unfortunately i think those may have been taken off?       
(and i know *High Tension* isn‚Äôt on there, but i feel like i should mention it nonetheless, because holy shit.)"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,There's a 3rd and you didn't know ? LoL it was released in 98. Rent it from a video store when I first seen it on the new release shelf. Than eventually I own it. Can't remember where I got it from now. Think it was Movies Unlimited.

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I remember this thriller movie i watched from netflix, but can't remember the name! Help me!

Okay so its either spanish or french and a thriller:

Here is the plot:


A woman moves to an apartment to get over with a trauma caused by past incident where she was raped. As she started living alone in the apartment, one night she sees the same man who raped her in the streets from the window. She freaks out and decides never to go out. She ordered a lot of security stuff from online and put cameras everywhere in the house and different types of locks in every door and kept watching everything from camera. 

She then sees a girl soaked in blood moving inside her house from camera, but couldn't see in real. She saw blood too on the walls in the house from camera but it was not there in real. One day the rapist somehow entered her apartment and stabbed her while she was at bath but she manages to save herself by probably killing him, but with all those blood she ran everywhere in the house to escape and realized the girl soaked in blood she saw from cameras earlier was herself. 

She had the ability to get hints for whats gonna happen to her.

Has anyone seen this sorta movie?"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Urban Legend 1998?
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,isnt this the conjuring
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,[https://youtu.be/OofMJ6cwzLM](https://youtu.be/OofMJ6cwzLM)
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,The pact?
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,The Boy looks really good though. This movie was really bad. I remember the twist was pretty laughable. The man kinda looked like one of the guys from the old home alone movies.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,That sounds like The Boy. Creepy doll is treated as their son. Doll/house are haunted. In reality there's a man living in the walls.

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Part 3 is the worse of the series.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I didn‚Äôt know that!

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,The second and third are super fun. Pretty much the same movie.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,No but that sounds wild.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I think the silence of the movie really amped up the scare factor. Loved it and I heard they're working on a sequel
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I do want to read the book someday! Thanks
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I cant really answer this myself as its been years since I've seen this but it's based off of koji Suzuki book Ring. I dont remember all the details but I do no it explains it from when I read it like 4 years ago. Hope that helps!
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I really liked it! Gonna add it to my October movie list.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"i was also impressed! it was very tense. overall i'd consider it more of a thriller than true horror, but it was an interesting concept and John Krasinski's performance was phenomenal.

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Why is everything turning into THIS. It is exhausting.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Yes a killer dated mess with a house full of entitled rich sorority girls, and they somehow magically become commandos and make the killer pay."

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Classic
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I thought he's a good movie! The performances are cool but what caught my attention was the script. Although it sounds like crazy, he proposes a story that is well resolved after all. The script is very elaborate and doesn't seem clich√©. In rotten tomatoes his grade is low but I liked it a lot. He doesn't make the mistake of wanting to look much more than he presents. (Sorry if the english is bad haha)"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Agreed I didnt think I would like the remake as much as I did!
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"true! it's absolutely iconic. i really liked the 2013 remake, too."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"you have a point here.      

i think horror isn't ""dying"" as much as it is evolving, but i'm not sure it's an evolution i'm 100% on board with either.     
i do tend to see more and more horror movies being advertised nowadays, as well as more public interest and acceptance; from my experience, loving horror used to be considered sort of a ""weird"" or ""oddball"" trait, but now it seems to be... in fashion?    

obviously, this yields positives and negatives, because on one hand, a lot of really talented indie horror directors are breaking through to the mainstream in a big way and releasing some amazing movies (ex. Jordan Peele and Ari Aster): on the other, every time i log onto netflix and see a new horror flick added i groan internally.     

there seems to be an influx of plots rooted in very boring psychological/paranormal concepts, and most of them end up feeling very palatable and ""fake deep"" to me - almost watered-down. i feel like people put too much pressure on horror to be intellectual as of late, and it truly does lose its impact... if i can watch a horror movie and never think about it again, then it clearly hasn't done it's job; next-to-none of these movies are ""franchiseable"", and i really doubt any of them reboot-worthy ten years from now.     

tl,dr; the game is a-changin'..."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,thanks! very well-written review - safe to say i won't waste my time watching this one.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"no problem! can't say i remember it being a great movie, but it's always a lot of fun to revisit these sorts of ""half-forgotten"" ones :-)"

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"this sounds like *Spiderhole* (2010)!      

take a look at the wikipedia page[wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiderhole_(film))  and see if it fits the description."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"You're welcome! It's very interesting, as some stories seem very understandable between witchcraft to cults, but all original stories! Also I have to check out Ari Aster's two! I heard about Hereditary and Midsommar! Thank you for the recommendations too!"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I have not! I‚Äôd love to look into it. Thanks for the recommendation! If you haven‚Äôt already checked out Ari Aster‚Äôs two (feature length) films I highly recommend them. Hereditary and Midsommar.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"hmm that sounds very interesting! if what you say is true (which I believe you are XD) then i'll be looling forward to future horror flicks to! I also thought of going towards horror art to create anew original horror origins, etc. But it takes time and effort, which sometimes I don't have that motivational thoughts to do so despite being an artist. I wish we have a horror class here, but we don't unfortunantly. A horror film class sounds amazing in so many ways! A I'm an artist and interested in many fields even film. Have you heard of crypt tv on youtube? They have interesting horror flicks and some beautifuly done!"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I actually think we‚Äôre entering (or already in) a horror renaissance right now. Robert Eggers (The VVITCH, The Lighthouse) is pretty new and doesn‚Äôt seem to be going anywhere. Ari Aster‚Äôs two horror flicks were also game changers imo, but I guess he‚Äôs said he doesn‚Äôt wanna make horror movies anymore. We‚Äôve got kind of the tail end of Rob Zombie, more to be expected from Jordan Peele, and some really good indie artists making interesting horror flicks especially with A24. I‚Äôm taking a horror film class and read that historically, there‚Äôs been apparently a pattern with horror film Renaissances: they tend to start during war, social tension, and increases in poverty. I‚Äôd say we are kind of in a time where our tastes are darker than they used to be. I am not excited about much in the future, but I am looking forward to new terrifying and beautiful horror flicks. üòÜ"

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Honeymoon 2015
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Thank you so much!
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,im sure its called southbound
HorrorMoviesONLY,com," Hi thinking, I'm Dad!"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"That is a very similar scene, but it's not the one I'm thinking of. In the scene I'm thinking of, it was definitely an old-timey scene of some type, I'm pretty sure Victorian era England, although I suppose it could have possibly been colonial America. Lots of elaborate formalwear. And I remember it was a Christmas dinner scene with decorations and I think someone was singing carols? There were 20-30 people in the scene, most of them at a very large table. 
In trying to find this particular roasted turkey resurrection scene, I've seen many. Its such a weird trope.

Don't know if this helps or not, but my dad is the only other person who remembers this scene, and he says he remembers it being a roasted pheasant, not a turkey. I remember it being much larger than a pheasant, but then again, I was a kid."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Lmao yes. Not sure that that exists.

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Yes, and I did make several short horror films in high school and college. None of which were any good and haven't been seen since they were bansihed to the sock drawer of a dresser I left in my old bedroom when I moved out of my parents' house a decade a half ago.

I was also inspired by Evil Dead, but probably even more so by Evil Dead 2. Others that inspired me to make my own include Creepshow 1 and 2, Eraserhead, My Bloody Valentine, and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Creepshow! one of the best movies, the second one was even better, one of the stories is about a blob thing in the middle of a lake and it kills people by swallowing them into itself. These people get stuck on a floating raft and can't get away from it. Anyways check it out Creepshow II"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Yep, that's Creepshow. The third portion of the film you're thinking of was the farmer who was turning into a plant, played by none other than Stephen King himself! Also, fun note, the guys burying people up to their necks in sand and leaving them to be drowned once the tide came in was Leslie Nielsen, in possibly the only think I've ever seen him in where he was a straight-up stone faced killer."

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,A good movie I supposed. I sort of suck when giving thoughts on certain movies lol I guess it's scary. Was the 2nd time watching it sense I got it.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Inside came out on my birth year and slither before my birth year

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Cube or Cube 2. For sure
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"He'd fuck it up. For starters, he'd be in it."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Let us prey is a great Irish horror movie.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"No not necessarily, I probably would‚Äôve still considered it a good movie.. shock factor, how twisted, creativity and all taken into consideration. I‚Äôd say ‚Äòto each their own‚Äô on this one. And I wouldn‚Äôt sit it down and show it to my family, but if I was

I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I wouldn‚Äôt want to say one‚Äôs worse than the other though. I honestly can‚Äôt really say. I used to be a drug addict and I‚Äôve been in situations with people I was sleeping with otherwise where I was too messed up to give consent but I don‚Äôt count that as sexual assault (I personally don‚Äôt, not saying other people shouldn‚Äôt)."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Maybe the cube?

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Dang bro. So if the 4 year old being raped by his father wasn‚Äôt tranquilized but put up a fight it would bother you but a child being unable to stop his drugged father from raping him is a ‚Äúgood movie‚Äù 
Yikes. To each their own I guess? 

I also don‚Äôt wanna assume you‚Äôve never experienced sexual assault but lemme tell ya, being half conscious and unable to stop what‚Äôs happening to you is much more horrifying üôÉ"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"love this! simultaneously cute and menacing - if it was my kid, i'd proudly put that on the living room wall to freak the guests out. you've done great work with the colours, too. has a sort of oldschool 35mm feel to it..."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"i think the other one you're looking for is *The Shrine*!    

Set in Poland, a rookie reporter on the case of a missing teen, they end up killed by cultists sledgehammering the spiked mask into their faces... ring a bell?"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I wouldn‚Äôt say banning it is the right way to go but it should come with an extremely strong warning label.

I‚Äôve seen A Serbian Film several times, closer to ten ..? (Anyone reading this: just because I watched it doesn‚Äôt mean you should, seriously). I know whatever way I explain this it‚Äôs going to sound r/iamverybadass but I actually really genuinely enjoy that movie. I have a thing for shock factor, I like to amp it up as far as possible. And that movie has tiny shock factors all throughout that I have time to forget about and give me a spark each time I‚Äôve seen it. I‚Äôve shown it to several friends. To me the bad sexual assault scenes that would make me uncomfortable are ones where the victim is struggling against the assaulter. Or where the movie even feels real. That.. for reasons I wouldn‚Äôt like to get banned for spelling out.. didn‚Äôt happen in A Serbian Film. And it feels more like the worst drug trip **ever** than something plausible.

I missed the family part in OP‚Äôs post, definitely definitely not recommending then üòÇ"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I‚Äôm against the concept of banning films usually but I make an exception with that film. 
The best review I read about it said ‚Äúyou think you want to see this movie but you really don‚Äôt.‚Äù And I really wish I had taken their advice. 

While it does horrify which technically would make it a horror movie, it seems to push boundaries with sexual assault to a point that seems extremely unnecessary. There was one shot in the whole movie that I would even consider art and it was the scene with the checkered floor (I‚Äôve blocked most of the film out of my brain at this point) everything else felt like gratuitous shock value. It gave me PTSD for a few days/ weeks, if I‚Äôm being honest. And I can usually handle graphic sexual assault scenes.

Also op says their friends and FAMILY are gonna be attending so I can‚Äôt see that going well üòÇ"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"So I think I locked down my list...

Old - Reanimator 

Foreign - Baskin

New - Midsommar"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"The issue I had with A quiet place, was that it had a lot of scenes which were ment to be scary and there was much less focus on the horror part of the story. I had somewhat of a hard time relating to the characters in the movie. One point that was brought out to me is what made that movie work for others is that they could actually relate to characters.

You say you dont scare easily either but the question is rather if this has always been the case?

Saying that you dont watch anything less than 5 is very fishy strategy. Essentially this has been my strategy too and it causes me some distress at times because I might miss out on some great movies. The strategy I have adopted is to follow the reviews of some established players that have voted on past movies the way I have. So if the average of a movie is 3...but dude has voted 8 then there is a good chance I would too."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Interesting ideas. I'm female and love horror movies but I don't scare easily either. A quiet place was good, but not scary. The most scary movies in my opinion are the ones that could actually happen in real life. I've seen some real disturbing movies which may fall into that category as well. Out of a 10 rating, I won't watch anything less than a 5, which only tells me the movie is watchable, nothing more."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,We interviewed the writer/director Cody Meirick on our podcast over at Ghoulish Cast. He was SO nice and gave so much background info.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"There are moments when the practical effects do look dated, but man that ending!"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I think it dated badly. I still love it though.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Reminds me of this movie where someone invents a camera that can take pictures of the future.  Wish I could remember the name of it now.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Yeah basically
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,So like death note but with a camera?

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Oh yea Hereditary definitely had an interesting vibe. I have high hopes for it too!
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Guy that directed Hereditary.  I have high hopes for this one.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Looks interesting, gives me kind of a Wicker Man vibe."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"I'm conflicted. I wan't to up vote because I agree with you, but Brendan Fraser's Mummy wasn't horror. It's Fantasy/Action/Adventure."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Come on dude, The Mummy isn't a horror movie."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"For me Dream Warriors enters into so-bad-it's-good territory, whereas Dream Child was a near miss in terms of quality."

And Martyrs."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Haunting in Connecticut?
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Dangit. Sorry I couldn't help.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Looked at both. Didn't see bugs flying. And the candyman one wasn't it.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,It also may be Candyman where the bees fly out of his mouth
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I may be completely wrong idk. But I think there's a scene where the priest has flies flying out of his mouth

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Quiet place was first, others copied it."
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I know right! That movie had given me nightmares.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,I wished Mr. King would have made an appearance as a cameo. Like in the good old days.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Nvm , the movie is called ""The Others""üòäüòä"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,This movie was pretty good! Watch Honeymoon if you want something similar but better. Even Goodnight Mommy which is more psychological. 
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Your right I never noticed that!

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,Thanks J's for the comment! Be sure to subscribe to the channel cuz I upload at least once a week :)
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Found footage are my favorites, totally agree that it feels more real.  Can't wait to watch Creep and The Houses October Built,  didn't even know those movies existed.  "
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,It was better in the theatre tbh.
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Resident Evil. I know it's an over done one, but honestly I mostly watch RE for Milla Jovovich. üòçüòò

If you have Amazon fire TV you can watch Little Dead Rotting Hood... It's not bad, for a free horror movie... It's on Pluto. BTW"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Films (and horror films in particular) are amazing in their ability to develop archetypes through unique fictional characters. In the more layered, symbolism-laden movies/stories, each character represents a certain ideal, or certain values, positive or negative, that tap into the collective imagination of the viewer. And that's where the audience is being drawn in, the recognition of those 'archetypes', those symbols representing real life values, and forces."

HorrorMoviesONLY,com,bone tomahawk is so good because they dont bother setting up the freaky stuff at all. its just some kind of Western until it isn't. I had not idea what was in store but it was a pleasure to be surprised for once in a blue moon

Anyway, the name of ""Train to Busan"" kept coming up everywhere I was checking movie reviews. I always check out flicks that have good word of mouth, I use IMDB all the time also but many users reviews are biased with agendas. When I finally saw it, I was very surprised at how good, well acted, and action packed it was! That's why I never discriminate when it comes to movies! I watch movies from all countries as much as I can! I have found some great ones from places that I never thought even were into movies. Anyway, enjoy!"
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,subtitles aren't an issue. thanks for the suggestion
HorrorMoviesONLY,com,"Umm..yeah. For some odd reason, the trailer for the movie isn't playing on their website. I'm using my smartphone, that may be the reason.

horror,com,Happy Death Day and the sequel really surprised me with the quality and they‚Äôd be totally kid friendly based on his watch history.
horror,com,"I always forget about Chronicle, but that's probably because it isn't horror, persay. I remember enjoying it quite a bit anyway though. Definitely got darker as it went on.

I'll look into Zero Hour though, thanks!"
horror,com,The Ritual is definitely one of the best horror movies to come out in the past couple years.
horror,com,"Okay, okay point taken. Meant to be supportive but maybe the intention was lost:)"
horror,com,You mean... the three-minute short film?
horror,com,"Hated it, thought it was extremely boring with constant build up and no payoff. Outside of the ""scene"" where I thought that it might pick up, it went right back into its lull where there was buildup and again, no payoff. I went to a packed house opening night of it, and there were multiple bewildered ""what the fucks?"" During the ending. I dunno, just really wasnt for me."
horror,com,"It‚Äôs going to age very well/ be regarded as a horror classic in 25-30 years along with other movies released in the 2010s  (Midsommar, The Witch, Sinister etc)"
horror,com,I finally finished it on my third try. Wasn‚Äôt for me I guess.
horror,com,That was a damn good movie and I don't care who says otherwise. You can tell the filmmakers really made an effort to honor the spirit of the games.
horror,com,"I'm glad some people give the movie credit. To this day, there hasn't been a 'feel' similar to Silent Hill remotely accomplished. If not for the last act of the movie, I genuinely think it would be mentioned more when talking about horror."
horror,com,"Session 9...now there's a movie I haven't heard about in a LONG time. I remember liking it quite a bit. Some contractors are renovating an old asylum when one of them finds the old session tapes of a very disturbed little girl...am I thinking of the right film? If so, I remember loving it."
horror,com,I have found my people!!!
horror,com,"For me, Ju-On. Even the American remake ""The Grudge"". 

Gore doesnt really scare me cause it's fake and there's so much worse things than gore (feces, healthcare workers are saints and do not get paid enough).

That being said, living alone ghost stories get me. Imagine hearing the groan, the uuuuuuuhhhhhhhh, when you're home alone. Imagine seeing a face peering in the window in the middle of the night. Trying to hide from something that follows you wherever you go.

Fuck that shit."
horror,com,Yes! Session 9 is easily one of the scariest movies out there. It always surprises me that more people haven't seen it.
horror,com,The Day After
horror,com,Let's go play at the Adams by Wendal W. Johnson
horror,com,Such a gorgeous and disturbing film. I re-watched it about a year ago and the visuals are still stunning.
horror,com,"Yep pennywise is a clown to some of the other gods, deity's and powerful creatures"
horror,com,I second that. This one's an instant classic out of Argentina. Highly recommended! I love horror movies but rarely do they scare me anymore. This one scared the sh**t out of me.
horror,com,Elephant
horror,com,The wasp factory by Iain Banks
horror,com,The alternate ending was the one I saw in theaters I bought it when it came out on DVD and saw the lame jumpscare ending I was so confused and disappointed.
horror,com,Hereditary
horror,com,I was a teen too when I saw it and wanted to fucking leave after that scene and ive always been an avid horror fan. That shit was scary.
horror,com,The long walk from the Bachman books
horror,com,"I had to look away during the 'head-banging' scene, it was so *unnatural* and unexpected. Something about it triggered a visceral fear response that I rarely experience in movies."
horror,com,Zombie by Joyce carol Oates
horror,com,That birthday party scene is probably the only movie scene to ever cause me to close my eyes in a fear response. I can't remember a film before or after that did that to me.
horror,com,"Yeah, I‚Äôve loved horror movies since I could barely talk. the movie scared me as a little kid when I saw it in theaters, but then I had my mom buy me the VHS and it showed that video in the beginning and I‚Äôd close my eyes the whole time. But years later I had a nightmare I‚Äôve still never forgotten which blended the woods from the Blair witch project, surrounded by movie aisles from Blockbuster. With the Well in the middle of the aisles in the woods, then she came for me. The movie was creepy but didn‚Äôt scare me too much. But the dream made me not like that movie anymore. Fuck that Samara bitch. I love horror and think it‚Äôs fun, but I still don‚Äôt like Samara. That nightmare follows me over a decade later."
horror,com,"this perfectly describes why I think it didn't hold up for me, I was definitely expecting more horror references"
horror,com,"This is brilliant, thank you for posting this!"
horror,com,Poughkeepsie Tapes. To this day that movie still gets to me.
horror,com,"It's true, I find demons and possessions to be un-scary in general. But there are exceptions to every rule. I'll check it out."
horror,com,The Boy was one of the most terrifying for me. It was probably the best plot twist of all the horror movies I watched. So creepy. Some scenes literally made me jump out of my skin!
horror,com,"I agree...it's a good series...as good and Jason and Freddy got to. The first few, like Jason and Freddy, we're arguably the most well done but like any series, it's gotta go somewhere. The later ones are a bit silly and nowhere near as polished as the first but thus is the way of horror series. 

In another 10-20 years, people will still look back on this series as a ""classic"". It's solid, memorable, wacky, gory, and the first few really solidified a genre and brought it to mainstream (for the first time in my life I have encountered kids who don't know who Freddy is but know who Jigsaw is)."
horror,com,The ending was so fucking crazy. I loved it.
horror,com,Jacob's Ladder
horror,com,"The ""I saw...her face"" sequence was the single most terrifying moment I have ever experienced while watching any movie. I was 15 years old watching it in theaters with friends when it first came out, and the fear was so intense that moment is still burned into my memory."
horror,com,"That's interesting. I finally gave up and saw it the other day. Pretty solid movie with lots of scares. I'd say it's much scarier than Grave Encounters, but not better.   
 The make-up on the faces with the pov go-pro shot of that girl scared the FUCK out of me."
horror,com,Martyrs ruined me for a while after watching it. I rented it through Netflix when they sent the DVD to your house. I immediately took it out of the player and put it in the mailbox. So many reasons that this movie terrified me.
horror,com,You bet. Even he thought Franklin was annoying. That's why he stayed in character because he worried if he broke character he'd ever be able to morph into that annoying ass again. ha
horror,com,"I also love how out of every Halloween movie...JH is the only one who decides to just fucking wail on Michael.  And it works, as if it stunned Michael that someone just thought to keep punching."

horror,com,"A Dark Song. The feeling of isolation and danger in that movie is almost unparalleled. 

Second place would have to be Blair Witch 1 and 2. There's something inherent about being lost in the woods with an evil presence that terrified me all the way through. 

Scariest scare I ever had was that scene in Hereditary in the beginning after the funeral. There was no noise and you can miss it if you're not paying attention, but it caught me so off guard and so early on, I'll never forget it."
horror,com,Have you ever had to spend a night alone in a forest with only a knife?
horror,com,"Maybe it‚Äôs just bc I live in the woods in New England, but everything about it is like a nightmare come to life to me. Being trapped with your family while being tormented by an unknown, and being blamed for those torments, is just unbelievably scary to me"
horror,com,"This is true. As another poster said, it's the Jason and Freddy of the 2000s, and like those franchises, the series has to get a bit more bonkers with each sequel. Of course the latter films aren't as good and almost seem silly, but when you get that many sequels, where else is there to go? Jason and Freddy did the same. Anything else that comes later will do it too."
horror,com,"Hatchet 2006, if he likes F13 he might also like this one. Its basically F13 but much much more gory but in a ridiculous way.

Phantasm series is also good because of how weird it is.

Behind the mask: the rise of leslie vernon is a great meta slasher. Its not meta like scream, instead its meta because of the character of Leslie Vernon who exists in a world where slashers (like freddy, jason and michael) exist.

Final destination series is also great. I watched them as a kid."
horror,com,most recently? i would say lake mungo. Most would find it rather boring but i really enjoyed it. if you have seen it you know what scene im talking about - i was paranoid for days thinking i might see myself in the shadows. also recently watched Toad Road but i honestly wouldnt recommend it - a little hit and miss.
horror,com,"Oof. I saw that in the theater when I was 7 with my mom and sister. My mom had to take me out during the iron scene. It still bothers me to this day, genuinely disturbing film."
horror,com,"Bring the hammer, Daddy"
horror,com,i would love to see if you draw the mother from hereditary movie! that would be awesome!
horror,com,The way she moved....shudder
horror,com,"I feel like there are probably a ton out there just like that but we just haven‚Äôt heard of them. I try, huge horror/thriller fan so I‚Äôll watch like 5-10 a week in hopes of finding that rare one."
horror,com,[Alternate ending](https://youtu.be/wXnzLs8oCHc)
horror,com,"Honestly? Silent Hill. It's not the greatest, but it still created an atmosphere I've seen yet to be properly imitated."
horror,com,"That's exactly the same thought I had going into ""The Frighteners"" when I was a kid - it was going to be a fun ghost movie like ""Ghostbusters."" Turned out to be the first ""horror"" movie I watched in theaters. Also, it was rated R. I don't even remember how my friend and I got tickets."
horror,com,"&gt;Its the best franchise in horror history in my opinion

 You are entitled to your opinion but goddamn that hurt to read."
horror,com,I still think about that movie and every time I think about rewatching it I can't. Seeing it in the theater was a real experience and pretty upsetting if I'm honest. When I walk up the stairs in my house I still imagine Toni Collette scuttering across the ceiling.
horror,com,Ruined me.  Saw it at home at like 10 years old.  My my.....  Big mistake.
horror,com,"I tried that with The Conjuring today. Still don't get it. Horrible acting, totally Hollywood storytelling, not even a little scary , and just a bunch of stupid jump scares."
horror,com,Under the Stairs. That movie was all kinds of f up.
horror,com,"if you don‚Äôt mind subtitles, Art of the Devil 2 (thai) is pretty scary. let me know what you think if you do decide to watch this."
horror,com,Imagine Jason crushing that guy's head in 4k
horror,com,Probably Silence of the Lambs because I was way too young for it when I saw it. A more recent one that really creeped me out was Gerald's Game. The foot licking part still randomly enters my brain right before I go to bed
horror,com,I‚Äôve seen it. It‚Äôs not bad
horror,com,"true true. if the movie is so good, i won't watch it again. those movie scenes will kept replaying inside my mind because i love remember the sensation of watching it for the first time."
horror,com,"That‚Äôs unlikely. It‚Äôd make all the teases of IT being alive,useless."
horror,com,There's also a bunch of stories of IT wreaking havoc every 27 years prior to the two main stories of the losers. Could be set in the past.
horror,com,The Ritual rules so hard and got slept on by so many people
horror,com,"Lol, yeah, I'm aware. Stephen King is just a long read. And I've never been interested in it. But thanks."
horror,com,Hush is probably the scariest movie I‚Äôve seen. My dad is mostly deaf (basically have to yell for him to hear you if his hearing aids aren‚Äôt in and even then it‚Äôs questionable if he‚Äôll hear you) and it freaked me out so much to think what could possibly happen if he lived on his own like that.
horror,com,"When I was little, the original House on Haunted Hill. The scene in the basement with the caretakers wife freaked me out as a kid. 

Most recent, Paranormal Activity. I saw it opening weekend, it freaked my buddy and I out so bad that when we returned to my buddies dorm room we opened his door and forgot about the demon mask that was on his lamp. We both freaked out once the light shined through the mask."
horror,com,I'd be foolish to dare!
horror,com,"The Ring was one of the first movies that genuinely scared me. Then it was the Descent. I think Insidious freaked me out pretty good too. And the first Paranormal Activity.

But if I were to watch any of those for the first time nowadays, I'd reckon only The Descent would still get to me. I think a part of it is the claustrophobia and darkness, since those are genuine, common fears."
horror,com,"now that you mention I, Tonya, I am going to try watch that movie this weekend. I watch the documentary about it and wtf Margot Robbie is such an excellent actress"
horror,com,"My SO and I watched the entire series right before Jigsaw came out. We hadn‚Äôt seen any of the others previously. It scared me pretty good, but we love the movies."
horror,com,"Sir, dost ye begrudge this nobelman‚Äôs honor!?"
horror,com,The Cell. With Jennifer Lopez
horror,com,The original Texas chainsaw massacre. That movie is just so fucking disturbing. The thing that scares me the most about it is that it feels like something like that could happen in real life.
horror,com,People don‚Äôt like the newer ones but I just love them. It‚Äôs one of my top five horror series! I feel like they just get better and better. Obviously the first movie was the best but I just love them all lol.
horror,com,I saw that on prime. They actually have quite the selection of possession/haunting type movies that are decent.
horror,com,"The show is on Netflix. From what I know, Slasher is in countries like USA, Canada, Austrailia, Netherlands, and Italy."
horror,com,"Definitely has to be ‚ÄòSigns‚Äô. I‚Äôve watched scary movies since then, but the literal fear that I felt when I first saw that movie was unreal and it‚Äôs a high that I‚Äôll never be able to get again. 

Fuck that birthday party scene. I refuse to watch that movie again"
horror,com,"Back in the day when I clerked in a vid store these were the top 4 movies I'd recommend for kids that were past Disney stuff but not ready for Texas Chainsaw:

1-Something Wicked This Way Comes

2-Watcher in the Woods

3-Woman in White

4-Spaced Invaders - not a horror but a fun 90s movie about aliens that land on Halloween &amp; think

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some I think the kid would like, some are old some are new:

\-Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

\-Return to Oz- a movie many kids will tell  you that still haunts their dreams

\-The 2 Goosebumps movies

\-All the versions of The Addams Family Movies, including the new cartoon version. Not horror but still fun.

\-Same for Beetlejuice, fun but not horror.

Maybe show him some old stuff too like the classic Universal Monsters &amp; then the Hammer remakes."
horror,com,"Bummer you didn't like it, I loved it. I think it's in a different league than most studio films, Eggers is a former production designer, the way he immerses viewers into his stories, particularly the matter-of-fact approach with The Witch is what did it for me. It's a really simple story aided by masters of their craft in their respective departments. 

If you're not big into the arthouse horror genre, I get it."
horror,com,The shining by steven king (yes it is an actual book)
horror,com,Same! Saw it on a bootleg DVD with that ending and fucking flipped! I was also like 15 or 16 and completely convinced it was real.

True: a rare photograph can be glimpsed by my mind's eye whilst I slumber. I must reiterate, dear reader, that it wasn't terror that begets me when this occurrence touches my dreams, but I have taken a liking to it none-the-less."
horror,com,The Hills Have Eyes and The Ring terrified me as a kid.

horror,com,"All Hallows‚Äô eve. It‚Äôs the ending, the phone call part. If you know you know. The most disturbing films I‚Äôve watched weren‚Äôt horrors though: it‚Äôs a tie between ‚ÄòSeven‚Äô and ‚ÄòAll Good Things‚Äô starring Ryan gosling. Latter is probably worse as it‚Äôs based on a true story (but seven is a great film.) Robert Durst is suspected of having killed lots of people, including a woman who went missing near his shop and I won‚Äôt say who else because that‚Äôs shown in the film. Ryan portrayal of Durst unsettled me for days. Just empty, devoid. Usually things like that don‚Äôt get to me but it made me feel physically sick"
horror,com,"Yeah, I‚Äôd be very interested in watching this."
horror,com,"I don't think the VVitch is scary as much as it does atmospheric dread and suspense well. I personally liked it because it seemed like a Nathaniel Hawthorne story to me, particularly ""Young Goodman Brown""."
horror,com,"Hello 

Not op but thanks for the juicy information

Where do you watch this show (legally I mean)?"
horror,com,There was something about The Bay that really freaked me out. There's a scene where the main character is trying to do a report and it's dead quiet except for screaming in the distance. That scene has stayed with me and I couldn't tell you why.
horror,com,Lights Out!!! My roommate and i tried watching it together and kept our hands over our eyes until about 15 minutes through when we gave up

Does nothing for me anymore."

horror,com,"I really liked it as well. Crazy K's story still sticks in my head today, especially the scene with the neo nazi in the cell and the rehabilitation scene. 

Sadly the social commentary STILL can apply today."
horror,com,"Yeah. I wanna revisit it, because, contextually, Noroi came out like 2 years before Paranormal Activity. So it might help to view it under that lens of a found footage/documentary horror movie in that time."
horror,com,Who you talking to?
horror,com,Wolfman and Dracula from the Monster Squad !!
horror,com,"If you like the film, you‚Äôll love the source material: ‚ÄúThe Body,‚Äù one novella in Stephen King‚Äôs four-part collection, Different Seasons. I believe it‚Äôs one of his most biographical stories, and the shorter form suits him perfectly."

Truly incredible screenwriting: ""Let's just stay ahead of the wind!"""

I saw it in the theater, and really was not into it? I might like it with different expectations set though."

and im sorry, i did not know that this movie was so popular on this sub. i have only talked to my friends irl about it, and no one liked it.."

horror,com,you should go drink and drive some more
horror,com,wow im sorry that you didnt like it )-: what made you feel like it was a stupid movie?
horror,com,You could try Poltergeist (1982) as it has a PG rating. I think if he could handle Friday the 13th he‚Äôd be good with this one.
horror,com,"I enjoyed it a lot on my first viewing. The Peachfuzz scene in particular really got me (people that I can‚Äôt read/may hurt me are a big scare to me!). 

The sequel, I wasn‚Äôt a fan of. It‚Äôs like, we already know his deal and honestly, I just didn‚Äôt like the main girl. But it wasn‚Äôt a bad film at all."

horror,com,"True.

I think maybe the issue is Netflix wasn't nearly as user friendly back when it first came to the streaming service so maybe it's just been buried a while"
horror,com,"Wolf creek 1 , Original Friday the 13th"
horror,com,"‚ÄúEye of the beholder‚Äù, my friend! Truth and beauty are usually not where or what you might expect to find!"
horror,com,"Such a great film. I grew up watching that kind of movie, I recommend terrorvision (I did see it was available on YouTube a while ago too) ghoulies and a gremlins knock off called munchies. It's been a lot of years since I've watched these but I don't remember anything that would blow the mind of a modern 13 year old. Get watching evil dead 2 also. It's a classic and a lot more slap stick that the original"
horror,com,2000s for sure. Great human horror movies

horror,com,"Ah, you right"
horror,com,Wrong turn films?? Lol too graphic
horror,com,"hmm, well i always mention this movie when its a topic and nobody seems to know about it. maybe its just because i havent been in the right community! 
i once applied for a job at a cinema and had to talk about my favorite movie. none of the people that worked there had heard of this movie!

i did not know that people talk about it so much in this subreddit! sorry! but glad people like it!!!"

horror,com,Petty good. Creep 2 became bit predictable at the end.
horror,com,[deleted]
horror,com,"Agreed. It felt like he knew he wanted out of the relationship (which, like most toxic relationships, was unhealthy for both of them to different degrees), but wasn't sure when he could break up with her. Should he have done it right after her sister's murder-suicide? I think she should have broken up with him then, but for him to be the one to break up then would have been potentially really harmful. So instead he continues to go through the motions, unable to truly be passionate towards her because he just does not have passion for her anymore. He'd let it reach a ""no-win"" point by the time Dani's sister died but didn't know how to accept the loss."
horror,com,"The original is surprising good imo. Camille Keaton is wonderful. 

Didn't like the remake. Felt too on the nose."
horror,com,Yeah it's quite liked on this sub . My favourite horror movies are also those kind of horror movies where some likable characters talking or doing something interesting.
horror,com,My wife was just saying how she thinks Duvall is ugly. The shinin' was on the other day. I think she's pretty.
horror,com,Hated the first one. Did not bother to watch the 2nd.
horror,com,lol no offense taken! can i ask you what made you hate it?
horror,com,"I could see how Marvel could get tricky since they have comic book art and it could be seen as a somewhat similar medium. Good to know, thanks!"
horror,com,The Frightners from 1996 is pretty scary while still being PG-13. Plus it ~~starts~~ stars Michael J Fox whose films are pretty kid friendly.
horror,com,I think everyone here (including myself) constantly raves about creep so I'm wondering how you think it's underrated?
horror,com,I hated it no offense.
horror,com,"Oh I definitely do, I think my problem with AHS was it was overly sexualised, I mean I can handle tiddy shots or what's in F13 but that show took it to far imo."
horror,com,"wow, i just posted about this movie and went to ""new"" and found your post right in front of mine! 
yes! i absolutely love these movies! i love creep so much! i love the actors and the characters! everything about it is great!

edit: and i like the second movie too! but havent seen it as many times as i have seen the first one!"
horror,com,It's fabulous.  I don't know anyone who didn't like it.
horror,com,"You'd have to ask Quentin if you want a defense of every word he used. But I agree the mechanics were inconsistent and that it was close to greatness and seemed to stop just short of it. It's sad that the writing wasn't as tight as the cinematography and sound editing. 

The director is quoted as saying:

""The goal with ‚ÄúIt Follows‚Äù was to be very deliberate ‚Äî make specific choices, and really try to craft everything from the camerawork to the editing, the sound design, the music. It was about being specific."" 

I find it extremely telling that he failed to include ""the script"" in this list."

All of them share the same premise (people being hunted by monsters, which is nothing new in the movie industry) but all films feel fresh.

horror,com,"I think a lot of people, Quentin Tarantino and myself included, thought the film's gimmick was going to be in service of a greater social commentary on rape culture, toxic masculinity, sexual violence, etc. When you get to the end and realize it was just a gimmick, it's a bit of a letdown. There's not a lot of substance to it. I have never said the third act is ""such a catastrophe"". That's a strawman. I just think it was capable of really taking a bite out of these issues and just barely nibbled at them. 

It was kinda cool how the entity's mechanics kind of mirrored a cycle of abuse, but what was the point of that? 

It was neat that one character's tablet looked like birth control, but what was the point of that? 

Was throwing the TV in the swimming pool some kind of commentary about media culpability? Because if that was supposed to be an analogy, it was pretty badly mangled. 

It came just short of connecting the dots for me. And Quentin."

horror,com,"Black man is seen as a hero, the savior to a white woman, was still unsettling for some people at that time. And as a comment on all that was happening, hes killed when they mistake him for a zombie.

All that night, all his heroics, for naught. Even without race, its about those men becoming desensitized to shooting human shaped things. Maybe they were quicker to shoot because he was black and didnt look like them. Maybe not."
horror,com,"A major point of the movie was to first subvert black stereotypes of the time by portraying our protagonist as a gentle, logical protector and the point of the ending was to reel audiences in to actively rooting and empathizing with this black man and to then draw a parallel to their current social turmoil by killing him(despite him clearly not being a zombie, but still being automatically perceived as a threat), forcing white audiences to face the uncomfortable reality of their current situation."
horror,com,"The fact that the ending wasn't in the book also helped.

The same with Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and Brian DePalma's Carrie.  Both added some really shocking, memorable scenes."

The Conspiracy (2012)

The Veil

Jackals

You probably have seen ""Safe Haven"" in VHS2 but I would be remiss if you somehow missed it.

While I haven't seen it, The Triangle looks interesting.

The Prime TV miniseries The Pale Horse

The TV show The Following might qualify for a cult. 

It's still only at festivals, but Dementer. Wouldn't call it a hidden gem, it's flawed, but I liked the overall twist et al.

I still Know What You Did Last Summer - Benson. Ben's son. That line still pops in my head when I hear the name Benson. Not the best ever, but memorable.

The twists in each section of Mindhunters were well done, I thought.

Perfect Getaway had some of the best red herring work I've seen. That one's a masterpiece."

It's also why I don't get too pressed about the 'is Silence of the Lambs a horror movie or a thriller movie' argument: there's a lot of intersectionality between thrillers and specifically slashers, and while Silence is definitely not a slasher, it's definitely got characters that fit horror archetypes, and in context, both Hannibal and Wild Bill would be slasher villains if the narrative focused more on them. It can easily fill both roles, similar to Psycho or a film like Se7en.

In my mind, a *lot* of murder thrillers are basically slashers that focus less on the killer and far more heavily on somebody in willful pursuit of the killer. To me, Psycho is the cement that laid the foundation for slashers, Halloween was what was built on that foundation once the cement dried"

horror,com," 

I only watched this movie for the first time recently. I was under the impression it was some sort of slapstick comedy involving spiders. I was pleasantly surprised. This was a real blast. It felt like it was trying to combine the tones of Gremlins and Jaws, and it succeeded quite admirably. There's some true terror and suspense here and first time director Frank Marshall does a good job with the buildup, letting us get to know the town and characters before all hell breaks loose. The film has strong production values with Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy (!) producing and Frank Marshall who produced several classics with them and was a 2nd unit director on films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Back to the Future, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. We have Spielberg's normal editor Michael Kahn working on the film, great cinematography by Mikael Salomon (The Abyss) and a great score by Trevor Jones (Cliffhanger, The Last of the Mohicans, Labyrinth) and animatronic effects by Chris Walas (Gremlins, The Fly) . Jeff Daniels is also a great everyman lead and he has great support from John Goodman and Julian Sands. This is basically a B movie with an A list budget and crew. How many horror movies, especially creature features, today would take the time and money to go and film a 15 minute prologue in Venezuela complete with sweeping helicopter shots? This movie has kind of been lost in the shuffle when it comes to films in the Amblin catalog of the time and it did OK but not great business when it came out but I'd say this deserves to be just as fondly remembered as those other films. There are have been talks of a remake of Arachnophobia but I'd say it won't be as good. Especially since they no doubt will use CGI spiders instead of the mix of real and animatronic ones this movie used and there is no doubt it won't look as good

Fun facts

\-the spider on the poster was removed from the VHS and DVD covers for some reason. They put it back on the Blu ray covers

\-the trailers and TV spots marketed the movie more as a wacky comedy. Featuring John Goodman's character heavily, even though he actually has an extended cameo. They also used the term ""Thrillomedy"" to describe it, something that hasn't really been used again

\-When Jeff Daniels came on board to play Dr. Ross Jennings, the film was a serious horror movie, one that Daniels told Philadelphia's ""Daily News"" was pretty formulaic"" ""You could tell that the lines were kind of written by computer,"" he said. He and Frank Marshall were hoping for a more ironic tone, so the script went through several revisions, and the filmmakers studied Alfred Hitchcock films and Jaws (1975) to get the tone right. One key change: Daniels' character was given a fear of spiders."

Zombie Jason at his best, and Tommy Jarvis is actually a great character in this installment too. The director knew what he was doing. This was the only Friday film that absolutely nailed what people love about the series imo."

horror,com,"I know a lot of people have already answered you, but I just wanted to chime in since I love this movie and haven't seen someone highlight the reason why it struck a chord with me. I've lived in very urban environments my whole life and have had countless run-ins with unstable people, and Art's mannerisms during the intro (prelude? before he's confirmed as malicious) are extremely reminiscent of how some of these people have interacted with me. There have been times where I've gotten out of a situation and reflected on how poorly it could have gone, and Art is a manifestation of that worst case scenario."
horror,com,"The fight between jeff Daniel's and the king/queen spiders was amazing. I loved this so much as a kid. I used to go around my yard and look for spiders and other creatures. This is partly what got me into horror/monster type movies as well as critters and gremlins. I'll always have a soft spot for both of those but especially critters. It's been mostly forgotten I'm afraid and I always considered it a classic monster movie. They effects were all pretty great, the critters were convincing enough. If it was remastered it could look amazing."
horror,com,"Dude, I literally watched the first Scream in middle school after reading who the killer was online, but the movie was so good at deflecting off of him that I thought to myself, ""Wait, is he not actually the killer? Did I read a fake spoiler?""

Its only redeeming quality is we got to see an invisible monster attack someone in a swimming pool with plugged-in appliances, which is probably the only time that's happened in the history of cinema. I laughed out loud at that scene.

I saw this with my daughter at the theater -- a huge horror fan -- and we still chuckle about how bad it was years later. It remains our low bar. Once in awhile we'll see a stinker and say ""well, at least it wasn't as bad as *It Follows*""."

Cage careening from affect to affect and voice to voice at dizzying speed was a great deliberate use of that Cage effect."

‚Ä¢ I just read this one on Wikipedia and never noticed before myself, but apparently at the beginning when ""Hugh"" shows Jay how it works and she sees the naked woman coming for them, it's the same actress who plays Hugh's mother later in the film

So if there's a sexual dimension to how It hunts and kills (which makes sense given how the curse is passed along) and It takes the form of its victims' parents when it thinks it's going in for the kill, there you have it"

horror,com,Joshua(2007)
horror,com,"WAY more interesting.  If it was seriously a movie solely about STDs and that, shocker, people pass them to other people, that'd be, like, Symbolism for Dummies lol.

I took at look at the director's IMDB page and I see another movie of his called [Under the Silver Lake](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5691670/?ref_=nm_knf_i2) came out in 2018.  Have you seen it?  I can't believe I'd never even heard of it - I'm gonna go see if I can hunt it down!"
horror,com,I noticed most of that but I never put together that they are going to the beach and hanging out in a pool when it takes place in the chilly autumn-like season.
horror,com,"I'm with you. I still remember seeing that moment for the first time in the theatre and it just *shook* me. It is really difficult to explain, it's just this uncanny confluence of the mood/buildup, music, composition and generally spooky imagery that hits like nothing else."

horror,com,"There's this spreadsheet called ""Analytics on Elm Street"" made by a guy on reddit using statistical analysis to rank horror movies. More or less like ""They Shoot Zombies, Don't They."" Somehow ""A Serbian Film"" made it to the 206 slot. I've been working my way through the top 300 Analytics on Elm Street movies but when that was added I had to shrug my shoulders and admit there will always be at lesst one movie in the top 300 that I've never seen."
horror,com,"&gt;That scene got me SO HARD.

Serious question - do you become aroused when you're fearful or afraid? I'm sure that's a real condition, but not sure if you're serious."
horror,com,It Follows was such a huge disappointment for me. I was so excited when it came out but it was all style and no substance. I did not even find it scary. Am I alone?
horror,com,Little evil

I didn't watch that, thanks."
horror,com,Yup. It‚Äôs full of bad logic and nonsensical plot devices. Still a fun movie though.

horror,com,"Alice, Sweet Alice, and to a lesser extent, Bloody Birthday."
horror,com,"But you see my point: cranky fucks or not, ""overrated"" isn't a discussion. There's nothing be retreaded, there's just a throwaway post that does nothing. Even if you agree with it, it still does nothing.

horror,com,"Oh yeah I left them out but I love both of them. I watched all the Omens although only the first one was good

Something like that"
horror,com,The Orphan (2009)
horror,com,"Oh wow I thought it was pretty obvious!  Though admittedly it was only obvious after I watched it a second or third time when I was really thinking about it.  I can see why they'd think that it's about STDs but (a) I don't think that's a particularly interesting theme for a movie.  Like, wow, STDs spread and they're bad, ground-breaking revelation.  (b) Specifically, the scene where Jay is dropped off in the middle of the street in her underwear and then talking to the police was one of the more overt pieces of symbolism of a sexual assault victim.  And she then spends the rest of the movie looking over her shoulder and being afraid to trust anyone.  
Dang I'm really bumming myself out! lol"
horror,com,The Omen and Rosemary's Baby (somewhat) come to mind.
horror,com,I just love the originality of the movie.
horror,com,Great list. I would also include Climax.
horror,com,Will do! I love movies that nail establishing an interesting atmosphere. Thanks.
horror,com,"Yeah, the plot is just bananas. They hear a woman screaming, see her running in the woods, and find blood on the trees, then just decide to break into a random farmhouse and chill for the evening, acting as if nothing had happened. Oh, and throw an impromptu birthday party. I don't think there was a single rational decision in the entire film."
horror,com,"very much agree. i finally watched it after hearing so much about it and was underwhelmed. it was a good movie, sure. but it didn‚Äôt live up to the hype and it‚Äôs not a horror movie i talk about."
horror,com,"Just to put your mind at ease, I've never posted about Eggers or Aster before. I've responded to stuff about *It Follows,* but not the others.

I think the opinions the films and directors you're mentioning are pretty mixed. This thread is evidence of it. I don't know what ""factual"" evidence you can use to say these directors aren't effective or good or original. This goes back to my original point: disagreeing with someone who says a movie is objectively well made is fine, but disagreeing by saying the are objectively poorly made is just the same thing.

Again, I love Hitchcock, but you're giving him a lot of credit for things that are either questionable or debated. Figures in the movements you mention certainly admired Hitchcock, but where is the influence on films of the French New Wave? I mean, Truffaut loved Hitchcock but their films could scarcely be more different. I think you make a better case him being diverse, which is obviously valuable in its own way. And this raises questions about originality itself - Hitchcock didn't write any of these movies, so should claims of originality be associated with him specifically? I don't think having a distinct style - which is what I think Hitchcockian means - is the same as being original."

Tarantino said it best:

horror,com,"I think King wants character development and a redemption arc for Jack. He also thinks Wendy is portrayed as being too weak. 


Me, I don't give a crap about development or arcs. And I think Wendy's hysterical behavior feels very suitable and realistic. King wants to follow the rules of storytelling, while Kubrick wants to do his own thing."

horror,com,"I meant child abuse victims who come forward as adults by the way. I don‚Äôt think social services go to the homes of people without children but they still get arrested and obviously there‚Äôs no evidence. Then again celebrities usually pay them off before court anyway, look at Micheal Jackson.

I have absolutely no doubt in my mind (as a solicitor for 2 back in 2008) that any good quality legal individual/team would tell this woman to go to the police, rather than milk her for legal aid. There‚Äôs three situations when you need a solicitor before the police, they are: legal aid (has a crime been committed, you‚Äôre not sure), involvement (you have committed a crime) and civil matters (some kind of disagreement usually between close parties).

If there‚Äôs an obvious crime which you‚Äôre a victim of and it‚Äôs not something small like ‚Äúmy husbands using my password to open a bank account‚Äù,  police before lawyer - always.

Gonna end this discussion because we‚Äôre kind of deviating onto the same point ultimately which is ‚Äútell someone professional‚Äù (be it police or legal)."

Right now what you're doing is doxxing a guy, who sounds like shit to be fair, with second and third hand allegations.  You don't have the right to push someone else into the absolute miserable position of coming out as a victim of this guy.  

If someone goes public, even if it's a legitimate complaint, they will be harassed and threatened by his fans and associates.  If someone wants to take that step, that's to be applauded, but it will be a nightmare that you can't force anyone into.  

Share your story, encourage others to come forward, but don't throw around other people's trauma to get your grievances met."
horror,com,"Yeah I understand your confusion. I clearly left part of a previous sentence I should have deleted - apologies. I was saying ""a statement is, in no way, guaranteed evidence that will be used in court."" But I rephrased it better in the paragraph above.

They do not investigate these statements if there is no lead. As someone who has been the victim, a witness, and is a mandatory reporter, I'm just letting you know that I've been told multiple times that there isn't any way they can question the abuser based on how little or how old the events were, but they would file it away for the next person.

As for child abuse, if a case of child abuse is reported, no matter how small, legally they must investigate. Legally, CPS must go to the home and do a wellness check. Sexual abuse victims do not have the same rights. Sexual abuse victims just prove fault, not prove innocence, as with a child abuse case.

Very few of these guys get arrested. As I've said before, talking to a lawyer first is the best bet. There are plenty of pro bono sexual abuse lawyers in all states who can at least answer emails. 

I never said she should do nothing and I certainly am not sitting on a moral high ground. I have been a victim, a witness, and am now a mandatory reporter. I have worked with rape victims and DFCS at a substance abuse shelter. This is not a moral high ground, this is just from experience: talk to a lawyer to see how this may play out, but don't expect much to come from it."

I liked that they tried to go back to horror, which is something that was pretty much missing since the original, but I don't think they did it properly.

Most of the time I feel like I'm watching a Hideaki Anno movie instead of a Godzilla movie. I *love* the dude's style, but he injected too much of it into the movie IMO.

The government being completely fucking incompetent in handling Godzilla is an amazing comment/critique the first time you watch the movie, but it feels like a complete slog on rewatches.

The way they end up defeating Godzilla feels too silly when compared to the rest of the movie.

Overall I liked Shin, hell I even *loved* it the first time I watched it, but every time I've watched it since then I feel like I could cut half of the movie and still get the same experience. It feels... *Overblown* I guess is the right word.

It was a nice experience but I hope it's a one-off and they go back to more ""normal"" Godzilla movies."

I don't believe anything he has ever said about his life. His relationship with his sister, among other things, seems like shocking shit someone would say when they are trying to create a fucked up backstory for themselves. Since very few people know who he really is, I think it becomes even easier to make up shit like that. It helps sell the depravity. Having spoken to him, it's all too stupid sounding to be real.

The Soskas, funny enough, don't *actually* deny being in the film, they just do so publicly, and they won't sign the DVD at a con or whatever and will become belligerent about it. If you approach them outside of a public setting, it's a different thing all together. They're shitty people too, though, so of course that's how it goes."

How do you think child abuse cases end up in court if there‚Äôs no evidence? Absolute worse: case it‚Äôs one word against another in which circumstance most court rooms side with the victim anyway.

I think not reporting rape due to having no evidence is the worst possible advice for victims of sexual assault and I can‚Äôt see how you can sit on a moral high ground and recommend she does nothing. If you genuinely think someone who‚Äôs been sexually abused or manipulated is better of sitting at home and putting it on Facebook because they‚Äôre worried there isn‚Äôt enough evidence to get a conviction, you‚Äôre either a terrible person or a terrible judge of morality.

They took out the descent into madness. His self destructive obsession with the overlook's history (the history that was the biggest part of the story that Kubrick completely ignores). He took away the slow suspicipn of Wendy against Jack.

Made Halloreen a complete joke, made Wendy into a whimpering mouse of a woman when Wendy was very strong and did not put up w Jack's crap.

They made Danny into this quiet little child with zero personality. Ignored Jack's drinking habits returning despite not drinking. Ignored his insanely abusive father backstory...

THEY REMOVED THE MALLET!! The part of the book where Jack smashes the mallet against his own face OVER AND OVER AND OVER was one of the most insane moments in a book I had ever read.

horror,com,"I'm going off of my own experience in a rape case. I'm just trying to help another victim of sexual abuse here. I'm explaining what happened in the case I was a witness for, and even though there was physical evidence, he went free.

If you do not have hard evidence, the police will file away what you said and no action will come of it. Later, should another victim come to light, that victim's lawyer will need to request a copy of your statement (or you request it to give it to them) and it may be used in the other case in conjunction with other testimonies as a way of showing a history of predatory patterns. However, if there was no outright sexual coersion or abuse, your statement will do little to nothing to assist in bringing him to justice. 

By giving a statement to police (which I am unsure if you've done but it's very triggering and the cops asking you questions may be assholes that doubt you), you may well just be wasting your time. This is not a stolen wallet. Her statement is, in no way, evidence. Because there is no physical proof (like a stolen wallet) if wrongdoing. 

This is he said, she said. She can go to the cops if it isn't too triggering for her, sure. But nothing will be done with it."

horror,com,"This.

It's not about squeezing a long book into an hour or so movie. When making a movie, scenes from the book are bound to get chopped off, and that's fine. Not all scenes from a book make sense in a movie. 

It's the fact that Kubrick changed absolutely everything about the story, the message and Jack's character. Then went on to disregard the complete ending sequence of the book.

The mist stuff, to me, was reminiscent of The Color Out of Space, which I thought was a bit of a let down. I thought the final scene was a bit unnecessary but didn't detract from my enjoyment of it."

The foreshadowing with the axe when Aaron arrives was brilliant and it used its short run time so well, I never felt bored.

The ending with the tapes was a bit cliche but still a solid film."
horror,com,"I wish we got more real life inspired horror like Zodiac. It‚Äôs such a untapped market. The Mexican cartel is ripe for a horror film. Not really one specific case, but their gruesome brutally would be perfect for a horror movie.

Would also like to see a film of the Golden State Killer. In a ironic way, he acted out frequently horror cliches i.e. playing deadly games, acting like he‚Äôd left then popping out again, phone calls etc. There‚Äôs also some current day commentary you can put in there in regards to him being a cop."

horror,com,"What on Earth are you taking about? If I have my wallet stolen and go to the police, I don‚Äôt need proof it happened in order to raise a case.

Anything illegal should always be directed to the police; the one and only time you‚Äôll end up in court is if there‚Äôs a counter argument against you,at which point you‚Äôre completely entitled to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave it thanks‚Äù. She‚Äôs not even got the the point where she contacts the police yetis zero cost. Ever heard the phrase ‚Äúa statement can be used in court as evidence‚Äù, this would be a statement.

It‚Äôs a terrible idea not going to the police, if everyone had the same principals and nobody went to the police guilty people would be walking around without getting arrested... like this guy, who‚Äôs only notoriety is via social media. I‚Äôve no idea why people are against the idea of contacting the police, it‚Äôs madness."

horror,com,"I think Romero is one of the few directors who managed to nail the only tone that works for adaptations of most Stephen King stories: cheesy, campy insanity. King might be a horror legend but a lot of his works just don't translate well to the screen (we all know the exceptions.) Romero realized that trying to do a serious horror movie based on some of these would be futile so he leaned in and made an amazingly entertaining B-movie."

It doesn‚Äôt surprise me to hear these things about him because he seems like a giant piece of shit, but I would definitely get this story out there.

&gt;Do you think that films that are a bit more ‚Äúhigh-brow‚Äù like Romero‚Äôs Dawn of The Dead and Carpenters The Thing count?

I would definitely qualify those as Splatter, and would actually say a large chunk of cosmic/body horror qualifies i.e. The Void, Hellraiser, etc. 

I also agree with your notion that Splatter can cross multiple genres. I‚Äôd qualify some of my favorite none-horror films as Splatter

If you missed it, I was surprised by how good the original Hellraiser (on Prime) was (I initially avoided it because ""torture porn"" is also not my thing, but it has a lot more going for it).

Resident Evil 7 was fucken awesome but extremely difficult. I haven't finished The Suffering but it has some cool ideas and all just not scary.  Check out Heavy Rain (a rather mediocre game with a cool serial killer hunt), Bioshock (fucken sweet man) and Yomawari (seen someone talk about this and it looks lit)"

The dad is a gigolo and single parent of a nerdy teen.  There is a great white shark that lives in the pipes of the house and eats people via the toilet.

horror,com,"I hope we'll see some thoughtful examination of humanity's need to rely on one another for protection, education, support, and health. This might come through some high-concept zombie films but I'm guessing they'll be more drama than horror, like the early seasons of The Walking Dead.

I believe we're going to see an increase in films about secret government conspiracies / distrust of authorities / misplaced trust in organizations working against our best interests, probably in a sci-fi or action context. However when we see these films might depend on who's in office after the election. 

I would absolutely love to see a return of the Action Science Hero character, very prominent in the '40s and '50s with a brief resurgence in kids' cartoons in the '70s. An educated scientist willing and able to step into the action and save lives directly. I'm certain this is a prominent fantasy for doctors, nurses, scientists, and everyone else intimately involved with the current pandemic. So possibly a non-dystopian virus-driven zombie film with this brave soul as lead protagonist would see success."

horror,com,"Love this movie-- it might actually BE about as close to a ""favorite"" movie as I could claim to have without really having one-- I didn't like the overall original story AS much-- but it DID have kind of this echoey spookiness in it's whole tone that I LOVED and was sorely missing from the film-- and it needed to add in a few of the scenes from the story as well. Especially one in particular: the story doesn't deal in Limbos, it tells you they went to Hell the first time and were granted some sort of pass in striking a deal-- the opportunity to live again if they could take out Jim for whatever reason. So the scene is that Jim is ready to cut the shit-- he knows they are who they look like, he can guess what they want-- so he ""holds one of them after class"" for a few minutes, and they feel each other out and talk fighting terms. Jim asks him, already kind of seeming to guess but testing his reaction; ""Where were  you? You know... Before. The kid tightens up and actually looks scared and goes; ""Hey, we ain't talkin' about THAT!"" Then as he's leaving, Jim tells him point blank that he's gonna kill him when they meet again. The kid kinda looks back and goes ""Thought you knew, daddio-- I'm already dead."" 

The overall tone, this scene, and a couple of other minor tweaks-- the movie would've been nearly perfect. 

Oh, also in the story-- it leads you to think it means-- as it DOES mean in the movie-- that sometimes just ""the dead"" come back. Only at the end of the story, after he's made his deal and been presently compensated, he thinks he hears footsteps behind him that sound more like hooves, and he wonders to himself if he truly made the right decision... If sometimes our PROBLEMS aren't doomed to ""come back"" in one form or another no matter what."
horror,com,"There is this Wes Craven movie called ""My Soul to Take"" and it's pretty decent, not torture gore. Also you might want to check out the website oldies.com because they have a good selection of horror and it might lead you to other less known movies."

It doesn't even know what it wants for Laurie, they took off her bloodline with Michael Myers established by the sequels but then she copies several of his trademark shots (the balcony shot being horribly done since she is just a granny) as if they were two sides of the same coin.

I hope the sequels get better."
horror,com,"The Ninth Gate (Hulu), The Devils Advocate (Netflix), The Taking of Deborah Lane (Prime) The Lighthouse (also Prime)"
horror,com,"Yeah i remember when i played The Evil Within 2 for the first time, it felt different than watching a movie. When you watch a movie you get attached to the characters but it's nearly impossible to put yourself in their place, mostly due to the fact that you're not in control of what's happening to the characters, and sometimes they'll make some decisions that'll make you wish their death even more.

When it came to this game though, i was so immersed that it almost felt like i was the one walking around Union, peeking on corners trying not to be seen by monsters so i could stab them in the back, realizing they're not dead and yeeting myself out of there while being heard by other enemies, swearing in every language that came to mind until eventually losing them with only a chunk of life left.

It was horrifying, especially the bosses, and the town hall... i had to pause at least 2 times during that chapter."
horror,com,"I.. hate jump scares. 99% of horror games rely on that in some way or another. That's why I don't like playing them. I know there's good non-jumpy horror games out there, but I'm also just picky with the subject."

I didn't have to think too much, it didn't have a bunch of too-stupid-to-live characters, etc."

1. Sometimes scenes will be shot specifically for trailers/tv spots or will simply just be left on the cutting room floor (deleted scenes). Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not losing your mind! Haha. 

2. More than like the final act‚Äôs Invisible Man was Adrian‚Äôs brother the whole time. So they had likely set up Adrian‚Äôs ‚Äúkidnapping‚Äù beforehand. Second, Adrian wanted Cecilia to look as crazy as possible but moreover, he wanted her to *feel* crazy. If he was ‚Äúkidnapped‚Äù then she technically cannot put any of the blame on him, making her question her reality and as to who was really behind the mask. It‚Äôs also a way for him to escape persecution from the law.

Hope this helps!"
horror,com,"I agree with you. However, I feel like the horror lessens after a while when you figure out how the enemies work. That's why I preach ""short-and-sweet"" when it comes to horror, but especially games. Big budget shooters and survival games just become action games after a few hours. Funnilly enough, the scariest games for me are point and click games like ""Oxenfree"" or ""Detention"". The simplisity of the game design and puzzles allow for very interesting visuals and narratives."

Movies are usually confined to screens, third person perspective, and either animated or live-action style- video games get to throw all that out the window if they want. Hell, devs can make the game infect your computer until you finish.

Plus there‚Äôs generally just a lot more fucking-around-and-finding-out with video games and their concepts- i.e. ocean horror movies always seem to revolve around sharks whereas ocean horror games tackle things like isolation and fear of the unknownz"

(1981) Possession is a great film. It's not really low budget per say, but it's freaky as hell with surprising practical effects that leave you squeamish and disgusted. It's also filled with building tension and dread that's very effective.

The soldiers were also trained tough to have the ""conquer everything"" team mentality, so maybe they thought they could handle what a mining/transport team couldn't.   


It was probably partly she was a woman as well since they make references to sexist discrimination still being a thing. (mistaken for a man joke, surprised Ripley can handle the loader)  


I gotta watch the extended version again. Such a great movie. The scene with the automatic guns in the corridor always gives me goosebumps."
horror,com,"IMHO, The answer, as in so many cases in the alien movies where ""stupid"" decisions were made, is ""Weyland"" or later ""Weyland-Yutani"".

Why did they put a colony on LV-426 in the first place? Ask Weyland-Yutani. They knew about the xenos already.

The ""rescue"" mission never was intended to be one, W-Y simply wanted to know what happened with the xenos and the settlers.
So it was never a question to go down there, the only question was, would W-Y finally get their hands on a xenomorph and be able to transport it to earth, in the bellies of a few marines, and maybe even get rid of ripley, who knew a lot of the dirty W-Y secrets."

Caught this last night, thought it was quite unique. Definitely not for everyone, as most of it is slow, uneventful and after its first 25 funny and relatable minutes, it is *very* vague. I liked this about it though, and I'm typically a person who looks for near-complete clarity in books and movies. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the way they used sound in this. 

There were one or two scenes that genuinely scared me, which is definitely a plus. I feel like this is one of those films that you'll either love or hate. The runtime is only 80 minutes, so I say it's worth a shot.

I've heard that one of the inspirations for Satoshi Kon's style is the movie Slaughterhouse-Five (1972). It does the same match cutting between completely different scenes that is common in his movies.

Black Swan has quite a few similarities to Perfect Blue as well. I think people go a bit overboard when they call it a rip off, but there's definitely things there."

I thought the Color Out of Space was ok.

The dialogue and framing/pacing is just often so bargain bin straight-to-video that the deeper themes and flashes of body horror brilliance just can‚Äôt do enough to counterbalance.

horror,com,"I've talked  about it in other posts but I'll be making an actual review at some point. I've been busy so that full post might not come for awhile but here‚Äôs the unfinished version:

I thought it was fucking amazing. Firstly the decision to dump the Saeki‚Äôs story in order to tell a new one that has similar themes was much needed as the original plot has been explored from every possible angle IMO. Secondly I love how unapologetically brutal Origins is as it sets it apart from others in the series that prefer to have their violence off screen. I also appreciate the return of the weird time warp shit from ‚ÄúJuon: The Grudge‚Äù. The only things I don‚Äôt really like about the show are the whole ‚Äúbased on a true story‚Äù thing, that bit about the face being twisted in fear they stole from Ring, and the lack of the usual opening text. Other then that I have some smaller issues like the pacing not always being perfect, especially between episodes, and some of the subtitles feeling a tiny bit clunky in some spots. 

**Final verdict**

Solid 8/10. This is on par with the original films for sure. I'm super glad I got into the series right before Origins was announced. 

Writing this out actually brought me closer to my actual review so thanks."

horror,com,"Absolutely brilliant show imo and I was so sad to learn it was cancelled after one season. I don‚Äôt know what it was that made horror fans miss it but I think it‚Äôll perpetually be one of those shows that people discover over time and ask, ‚ÄúHow did this only get one season?!?!‚Äù"

horror,com,"I really like this movie. It's not as good as the ones it takes inspiration from, but it's fun and the cast is great. I just wish the ending wasn't so abrupt and unfulfilling."
horror,com,"Yeah I've watched it three times now and it has held up greatly. I could see Cage's performance being a bit much for some people, but I loved it. He was so kooky and oddly likable in the beginning. Maybe it's because I'm kind of a weirdo too, but I found the entire family unit kind of likable and I liked that they all have their character flaws but still love each other. I thought the whole cast did a good job. I think Joely Richardson did an effective job in her scenes early on and I would've liked maybe a little more with her and Cage at the beginning is my only nitpick. The visuals and mood is outstanding and I thought the movie did an excellent job balancing humor with the first half having some hilarious moments contrasted to the third act which is very grim and unsettling. There's one image I will definitely not forget. Great movie and I'm so glad Richard Stanley is back directing again."

Overall, I dont regret reading it but I def won't be re-reading it."

I recommend:

* I Saw the Devil
* The Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance/Oldboy/Lady Vengeance trilogy
* Mother

horror,com,"I kind of disagree that the family should have been less weird from the start. One thing I liked is that the color just amplified the dysfunctional family dynamics that were already there. Cage's character worries he is becoming like his father and then takes on his father's voice, persona, and bad behavior (drinking, abuse). The older son is a slacker who wastes his time, then literally starts losing large chunks of time. The younger son is too clingy and dependent on his mother, then gets resorbed by her. The mother sees herself as undesirable and then becomes a literal hideous monster. The daughter is into weird occult stuff and then carves runes into her body. All the problems were there under the surface, the color just brought them out and, in many cases, made them literal."

I always wear a mask if I‚Äôm at work, the grocery store, or picking up food... bc those are the only places i have been since before this happened. I havent went to a retail store to go shopping. I have not went to a restaurant to eat since January. I have not spent any time with anyone besides my parents that I live with since January. Ive been asked to go on dates by a few people and have refused all. I make sure that i protect others by wearing my mask. I wear rubber gloves that i keep in my car most of the time going inside places as well. 

I say since before covid happened bc i typically don‚Äôt go anywhere but work... which with my hour commute both ways, my super long shifts, and getting ready for work and shower after i only have 6-8 hours before i have to wake up to do it again. On my days off I‚Äôm usually in my room doing nothing bc I generally only feel safe there when my anxiety is high. Now I did not have access to health care for 11 crucial years in my life, and i utilize my health coverage pretty damn well. I have bipolar disorder and treat it with my meds that are balanced out, as well as psych and a talk therapist. My therapist thought this would be a great place for me to finally do something ‚Äúsocial‚Äù that still makes me feel IN my comfort zone, while doing something new. We decided that before covid started, but after we have been playing it by ear. 

I didnt need to explain myself to someone who just assumed i was being some run of the mill Indiana Trump supporter that thinks ‚Äúcovid is a scam‚Äù... you have no idea how much conversation has been had about if i should go or not between my friends, my parents, and my doctor. 

This was something my therapist and i thought of as a way for me to get out of an antisocial behavior rut, while being in my comfort zone, and surrounded by things i enjoy. Everyone is experiencing this pandemic differently. Some of our lives have been affected drastically, and some very little. I was off work for two months, and ive been back for two months. I was terrified to return to work and am still pretty scared being there. I have been checking online, seeing how the event is handling covid safety, But wasnt sure (still am not, but most likely won‚Äôt go) how the events usually go. I just wanted to ask a few things to anyone who knew on this sub so I could have all information needed before I made my decision. 

I doubt you read all this, but seriously... consider being a little nicer to people when you know literally nothing about them."

I even think that both versions of pennywise were great (though Curry will always be first).  But the adult parts, they never really hit the mark to me.  The 90s one had a ton of great actors at the time and they were great, but their parts just weren't very cohesive to me and the ending was just dumb.

Then comes the part 2 of the remake.  And... same.  Great lineup of actors for the adults, same lack of cohesiveness that brings the story together.  And that ending...  I'll take the spider over that second ending any day of the week.  It was terrible."

horror,com,"How is supporting an institution while being safe controversial?  I don't think it is.  People who are totally dismissive of the best way to view a movie and who seem to want it to go away is what is controversial.

I totally reject both the idea of a movie premiering at home and then theaters or at the same time because it's ankling theaters.  In fact I think the home window should be lengthened to six months plus like it was years ago.  If theaters (hopefully just in the short term) are showing fewer movies in fewer auditoriums, they'll hopefully have to lengthen the time they have them to allow people to trickle in, so the home window has to be extended.

You should check your local (regular indoor) theaters to find out if any are open and showing classic movies.  Cinemark was going to open last week and show a bunch of classics; I'm not sure if that's still the plan when they do.  Out of the five times I went recently, three were old movies including *Superman* (1978) which I had never viewed in a theater.  It was great!  *The Empire Strikes Back* is showing at a single screen theater starting yesterday."

horror,com,"I interpreted it like the house beeing somehow linked to grandma. With the part where mum and daughter get lost in the house representing grandmas lost memories. At one point she even says since here husband passed away the house feels bigger, a feeling of emptiness. 
Also the point they escaped through the walls was exactly the point with the vase / grandfathers urne standing on the shelf.

I felt like grandma slowly forgot who this people where, getting slowly hostile towards them, so when the note with ""I'm loved"" got resurfaced (out of the maze of lost memories maybe) she remembered them again.

Peeling of here skin in the end stood for freeing here of the illness so that she could find peace.


No idea how that cabin and the dream of the rotting corpse ties into this."
horror,com,"Honestly, it was so metaphor heavy it reminded me way more of Mother! (not necessarily a bad thing) than any of the films you mentioned. I'm also struggling to see the connections with the films you've mentioned, as the themes have already been done by films that predate the ones you've mentioned.  The labyrinth, creepy cabin, mental illness/grief and self-harm all done many times before.

I absolutely agree about the direction of the film being inconsistent, but the character development wasn't needed, it just would have added to the drama and taken even more away from the horror aspect. I think that's because as you mentioned "" The ""horror"" aspect of this film couldn't handle the weight of the actual subject Alzheimer's &amp; its destructive, traumatic legacy"". It bordered a drama more than a horror.

Personally I didn't mind the ending, the tone was a bit off compared to the rest of the movie but overall not terrible. Lol at cinematic surround sound version of scab picking hahaha. Also hope my post didn't come off as cunty, am not trying to be at all.

horror,com,"I know that you are taking a very controversial stance, but playing devil's advocate, my local drive in is showing nothing but classic horror and comedy films and has seen a massive resurgence.

There should be no reason that local theaters cannot do the same thing.  There is a long long list of films I would pay to see in the theater.  This would keep them thriving in this situation we are in.

Also, Trolls: World Tour was supposed to be a theatrical release.  It was released online and made much more than the projected theater earnings.  As a person with a family of 6, I have to pay a small fortune to take the kids out to see a film.  $10 to $15 a ticket, popcorn and drinks and all that.  Now, I can rent the film for $20 to $25 and have drinks and popcorn from the grocery store.  I bet more families are jumping at that chance.

That being said, I agree with you that films made like that should be fully experienced in the theater.  But, maybe compromise?  Once things die down, make a theatrical rerelease for those that WANT that experience with a genuinely good film."
horror,com,I started watching it for the second time last month and currently in the first half of season 2. It's very similar to X-Files but is more story focused. It builds on monster of the week stuff and attributes them to one phenomenon later in the series. Where I think it lost people is keeping track of which character an actor is portraying and I agree with what someone else said is that you have the benefit of watching it back to back without having to deal with mid/post season breaks.
horror,com,Love Kevin Smith but Tusk is bad.
horror,com,"My impression is a bit mixed, from what I've seen.  I've seen some that do feel thoughtful and some that feel like their aim was just shock.  Honestly it's a hard one to nail down as far as an entire movement; there is a wide variety of films that can fall under that umbrella, with film releases from the late 90s to today.  I guess what I'm saying is that it's case by case, though I suppose that isn't the most satisfying answer haha."
horror,com,"What about Hardcore Henry? No horrror per se, but maybe similar to Upgrade in certain ways. It's an experience, that's for sure.

I suppose it just kind of clicked that the whole thing is intended to feel like a fast paced and bizarre fever dream that often leans into a sort of surreal German impressionist format.

horror,com,"I do lean very inclusively; I think a film can embody any number of genres, and that fluidity often creates a more fulfilling experience.  It seems to me that a lot of people shut themselves out from great films by approaching genre with a more narrow view.

As far as the disparity in film styles (mainstream vs. arthouse I suppose is an apt way to look at it), I think that a lot of this is tied to people's perception of mainstream releases representing the genre.  While I enjoyed both those films a lot in their own ways, it's just a given that films like **Insidious** are going to see wider releases, and more success with the general populace.  I don't think there is any shortage of stranger films though; finding them just requires more work.  Though I do think that with the success of studios like A24 as distributors, we've begun to see a lot more mainstream success for arthouse leaning films as well."

horror,com,Neither.
horror,com,Keith-Lee Castle as the father in *Young Dracula*. Best Dracula ever.
horror,com,I'm excited for it but I won't be getting really excited until filming is underway and/or Hollywood is back to 100% normal operations.

horror,com,"I think miscontruing rape as sexy is a pretty bad idea, no doubt its something awful and evil not disputing that, it's more the producers idea behind the rape scene that I think is awful."
horror,com,"I kind of felt nothing about it. It‚Äôs not scary, just gross and sad all around. I thought Smith‚Äôs movie *Red State* was a better horror film of his."
horror,com,Jesus Christ I want to fucking die
horror,com,"I consider this movie horror, as the events that transpire are extremely horrific. That being said, I love this movie, and it might be my favorite movie of all time. Growing up in the punk and hardcore community‚Äîand going on some extremely low budget tours myself‚Äîthey nailed the atmosphere and culture. Definitely in the top 5 of genre films released in the last decade, in my opinion."

horror,com,Lol--this really made me think of Chop Top scraping off pieces of his scalp to snack on in *Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2*.
horror,com,Whaat thee Fuu
horror,com,Congratulations you just described 90% of male actors
horror,com,"&gt;...there are definitely moments that are meant to ""reveal""...

My original point - if it's a twist, then there would be one moment of revelation - that's literally how twists work. Those ""moments"" (your pluralisation) are simply the times the plot gives you the information - again and again, from her first scene - that 'Joan' is Kat.

&gt;  I disagree with almost every point... To be completely honest, I watched it a while ago so don't remember everything...

Okay, I've watched it four times and again with the writer/director's commentary. Please do watch it again, and everything will be very clear to you."
horror,com,If we‚Äôre talking about old videos this takes the cake
horror,com,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasting_Away yep you were right.
horror,com,"You would probably get a kick out of a collection called Psycho-Mania! It‚Äôs an anthology of short stories from some amazing authors, all of whom tackle the theme of ‚Äòpsycho killers‚Äô in their own way. You can see which ones you like then look into the authors for longer stuff!"
horror,com,"It was up in the air; we never ""saw her die"" just her bleeding out; if i remember rumor was it was an homage to Dewey who was supposed to be killed off in Scream 1 and Scream 2 and they kept changing their minds lol.  And it was confirmed in her contract that she would come back in Scream 5 or could, so also with her show Nashville not being on the air and this movie looking to be big with horror franchises coming back hard, I can definitely see her coming back.  Even if she's a Randy figure who gets killeld in her second appearance"
horror,com,"I mean I'm not gonna NOT see it, it's Scream!"
horror,com,I don't know why I had never thought of that before.  You're 100% correct! Every inch of the USA is!  Thanks for the correction :)
horror,com,"I mean, the character Rachel Berry herself is almost a parody of Lea Michele, maybe Ryan hopes that Lea can learn to become a better person and have growth by playing this character, as the character Rachel has a significant personal growth. Unfortunately Lea has very bad self awareness"
horror,com,Sure is.
horror,com,Surely this is fake
horror,com,The Addiction (1995) - a black&amp;white horror film about a female philosophy student going over to the dark side.
horror,com,Its Christopher lee because look at him hes not only an amazing actor he as the best villain in every franchise he touched
horror,com,"""I do not drink... vine.  And I do not smoke... shit.""

:D

I love that movie."
horror,com,Glad to have that further reassurance!
horror,com,Lol
horror,com,"It wasn't exactly a bad idea; they just weren't comfortable with it. I wouldn't be either. 

But Frankenstein Must be Destroyed is the one where he is really an evil son of a bitch. He does a bunch of evil shit in Curse...for sure, but he's just so mean and nasty in ...Destroyed that the rape fits. And compared to stuff today it is very tame, but still disturbing as hell. Without showing any explicit content at all. There is a documentary on Amazon prime called Monster Madness where Veronica Carlson talks about it. It's part 3 of a series. Interview was filmed at one of the last Fanex conventions. It's pretty cool."
horror,com,Yep! I enjoyed some of those too
horror,com,"When I was a kid we used to get these at the Bavarian market all the time. I grew up in the US, and I remember when they were outright banned for a while. My family in Europe would include them in care packages they'd send us occasionally."
horror,com,"I appreciate the effort and read through it but I disagree with almost every point. 

To be completely honest, I watched it a while ago so don't remember everything but I believe there was a moment with a gunshot that is meant to be that twist ""reveal."" They do try and obfuscate the fact that they are the same person. They have two different actresses solely for the superficial tension added with the family that picks up Emma Roberts. If we knew outright it was the same person the whole last part of the movie would lose any impact. The whole giggling in the bathroom scene wouldn't need to happen. It was a deliberate choice to mislead the audience, but in no way was it earned. 

Either way, there are definitely moments that are meant to ""reveal"" the reality that they're the same person. Why need those if they're not trying to hide it? Maybe ""twist"" is the wrong wording, but they were trying to hide it and the only reason it works is because they used an entirely different person. 

All that said, I'll try and rewatch it soon based on what you're saying."
horror,com,The Purge films have a similar style of the fast pace vibe you're looking for
horror,com,"Man, this brings me to the Nightmare Fuel page of Commercials in TV Tropes. Wasted many hours with mini horror shorts that were made to sell something."
horror,com,"Yeah, IMO it could have ended at part 2 and I would not have been mad."
horror,com,That was hideous and I want to shower now.
horror,com,"He did a pretty good job, but he's a generic Legosi-ish version of Dracula.

Though he is the only version of the character to call a 6 year old girl a bitch."
horror,com,"It's good but can make it much better if your budget was 1000$ 
If i was made over night you should have given some more time to polish it 

Well nice work üëèüëèüëèüëçüèªkeep it up"
horror,com,"Will Kirby return? 
I remember hearing she would return if they did scream 5 or am I insane?"
horror,com,"Willem Dafoe; 
""Shadow of the Vampire""

This is a pure to it's roots film.

A modern version of  ""Nosferatu""."
horror,com,"Got my wife a Cameo from John Noble for her birthday, as we started dating while the show was airing and it was always one of our favorites. I asked him to play it as Walter and god damn did he deliver, even obsessing over a pastry in it. John's amazing!"
horror,com,I thought the evil within 2 was night and day from the first. A kick better experience in both gameplay and story
horror,com,"""And you will remember nothing of what I tell you..."""
horror,com,The jimmy the cricket song?! FUCK! First time I heard that song was while watching insidious. Freaked me the fuck out.
horror,com,Idle Penis: The Incel Years.
horror,com,"He was brilliant, a shame that the character turned into a joke in the third part."
horror,com,"Christopher Lee all the way...he had the height,the gaze,the intelligence and the moment those cameras started rolling his vampire persona took over. A truly amazing man. I'm 50 and grew up watching hammer house and peter cushion as his nemesis van helsing was the perfect pairing"
horror,com,He was Daddy AF in that role too
horror,com,"Oh, I didn't know Kinski played both Renfield and as Orlock, the Count as well. Personally, I think his portrayal of Orlock in Werner Herzog's version of Nosferatu is creepier than even the original."
horror,com,"Thanks for this!!!!!! Yeah I remember those options.  

I did hear one big rumor: that potentially the plot is that the people who made Stab are \*rebooting\* Stab the franchise with new younger actors replacing the OG actors who played Sidney, Gale, Dewey (who all died in Scream 3 lol). 

So it would focus on the actors filming a Stab reboot, but the twist would be that the OGs wouludn't know who is actually in danger from Ghostface, both themselves and the actors playiing them, since the Stab reboot would change the outcome of the original Stab."
horror,com,"In the words of Paul Reubens, ‚Äúthis is crack‚Äù."
horror,com,I felt like Tilda Swinton was under there.
horror,com,Never eating ice cream again
horror,com,"I think Glee likely exacerbated any issues that the cast may have already had. That show was demanding in ways other shows weren't. Since episodes filmed and aired so close together, they were having to master their songs and choreography within days. I remember reading some huge red flag interview when they went on tour after season 2 where they were all like, ""yeah, I don't remember the last time I wasn't at work or got to sleep, but it's fine because I'm doing it with my friends."" Pair that with the overnight stardom they all experienced, and it's almost a miracle it isn't worse."
horror,com,"This one isn't so inviting either.

horror,com,NPH is that you?
horror,com,"Not sure how long in US but I remember hearing the US version does not have a toy inside the egg.

I guess its a lawsuit waiting to happen over there.

horror,com,Watch there‚Äôs like a ghost face killer hashtag on tiktok or something like that to bring in the social media the way 4 had cell phones
horror,com,"Idk if she‚Äôs ever made a public apology, but I think they just went their separate ways. However, idek if they are on good terms still, esp cuz it seems that even tho they both work together on AHS, they never share any scenes, as if they‚Äôre avoiding each other."
horror,com,"I was pretty young and it freaked me out quite a bit, now I look at it and love the classic horror nods like the shadows on the walls and stop motion, so I dunno if I was a schnapps man I might try it, drown the childhood trauma with booze"
horror,com,What in the actual fuck?
horror,com,"It's also been mentioned that the central plot is a girl returning to her hometown after her parent's murder.  That can't be Sydney or Gale, so some think it's Kirby.  Could be a new character played by Samara Weaving- she recently seems to have ties to the project.

Oh, also, Hayden has been sporting a look very close to the ""Kirby cut."""
horror,com,I remember looking this one up on youtube.  No idea how it was supposed to make people want to buy the product.
horror,com,I had finally successfully repressed this memory till you decided to ruin my day.
horror,com,"Info dump here on a lot of random things:

Originally, years ago, *Scream 5* was supposed to be a direct follow up to its predecessor.  Jill would survive, with part of the story centered around her trial and how justice wasn't exactly being served with differing accounts of what happened, her playing up post-traumatic stress, and the insanity plea.  Kirby would survive into this film, alongside Judy Hicks. It was highly speculated but never confirmed that Judy would be a Ghostface here.  Little details known aside from this.

A few years ago, *Scream 5* was being pitched as a new jumping on point.  I don't know that they planned to bring anyone from the earlier films back.  The idea was that there would be a reality show based off of the Stab films where of course things go wrong. The idea got canned, but not before the idea of making it more meta came up- switching it to be set in the real world about the *Scream* series instead of stab, meaning all actors could return.

As of now, neither of the above are the central plot of *Scream 5*.  The only major plot detail is that after moving away from her hometown, a girl returns after her parents are murdered.  Many believe this is Kirby.  Some have theorized that it is a previously unmentioned child of Gale and Dewey.  Since ""parents"" are murdered, either Dewey could be dead or a ""step-dad"" could be.  It sounds like in any case, they want another run of *Scream* movies, and plan to intentionally leave this one on a cliffhanger of some sort."

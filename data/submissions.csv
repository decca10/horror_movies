HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,,Scary
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"So I just finished watching doctor sleep and at the end abra asks Dan if theirs more and dan says the world is a dark and hungry place maybe there's more like here or maybe there's something else something worse... I think the something worse is pennywise.  

So pennywise is a demon essentially,  technically he is an inter dimensional being consisting of pure light energy... he feeds on the essence that people have some people have way more than others do they shin.

It stands to reason that abra will grow up focusing her abilities to the point where she is extremely powerful. She will probably dedicate her life to seeking out others who shine to guide them not unlike a jedi. She will probably also angered by her father and Dan's death look for those who twist their abilities for unnatural evil purposes. The members of the losers club also shine so it stands to reason that at some point abra and the losers will meet up.


 Abra now a badass shine warrior will also be destroying evil hunted sites like the overlook hotel. So I see a cross over movie where abra defeats for real pennywise in an epic movie where dan also comes back as a force ghost pardon the cross franchise reference.  I think the losers club and abra will ultimately challenge the dark king of the dark tower. 

The king of the dark tower is stealing shine essence from kids to power a weapon to break through the barrier where IT originated from and if abra can kill IT then she definitely gets on his radar.  

Reasons why I think it WILL happen eventually.  

One Hollywood is out of ideas and this is a semi original idea. 

Two Abra is young and female and black so she is the type of hero Hollywood would be totally into and base a trilogy on.

Third you can bring back the actors who played the losers and Dan. So great ensemble cast.


Four it's all steven king's books so no cross company BS. 

Five it actually makes sense for once and would feel like the natural progression of these characters. 


Six it actually all in the same universe anyway so no portals to other realms or vibing to alternate earths. 

What do you guys think?",Shining and IT cross over coming?

HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,,Friday The 13th's 2009 Remake Is Seriously Underrated
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub," 
Ever seen a movie which genuinely gives you a headache and you feel like why does it exist. Don’t get 
me wrong, many sorts of movies do give the vibe of why do they even need to exist, be it from a story 
point of view or anything. But in this particular instance, this movie was like, nothing literally nothing. 
The run time from 155 minutes could be shortened to about 15 minutes. Heck this should have been a 
YouTube video and even then, it wouldn’t have been good. 
I don’t even care about spoilers here. 3 friends, one vlogger go to LA and yes the sad excuse for using 
the so called found footage style of filming is that the vlogger needs to keep her camera on at all times 
just so that she doesn’t miss anything worth recording. There is no setup, a sad excuse of a story and 
everything happens in the last 20 minutes of the filming. Now come to think of it, if the movie consisted 
of them boarding the flight, and then cutting to the end 20 minutes, would have been ok if at least for 
not wasting my time.
Could have been salvageable if the cutting room had decided to take out all the unnecessary stuff and 
released this in the form of a web viral video, and funnily enough this was the route they were 
superficially trying to portray with the opening and ending so called creepy dark text.
Don’t watch it. Please. It's not the worst found footage horror out there, but I guess we do not need to 
waste anyone's time with this piece of work.

HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"Ok, so it’s been bugging me for quite sometime, but I have a memory of two movies and I can’t remember the names of them, probably because I was very young when I watched them ( my parents didn’t shelter me.... ok one parent my dad). Anyway- 1st movie: it’s a creature of some sort that electrifies people to death, I remember a scheme of it latching to the underside of a car and then electrifying the guy in his bed around his neck. 

2nd movie: starting scene two boys (in old fashioned clothing) they hear pleas or murmuring, maybe chanting? One boy want to go look the other kinda wants to leave, but has no chive but to follow his idiot friend. They come to a cave/ temple some people are chained/ maybe the one guy is chained can’t quite remember.... anyway, the idiot friend gets closer to the guy ( all the people dressed in black) the guy looks at him as if to thank him (I think the idiot boy set him loose), then the guy proceeds to grab the boy’s face and stick his fingers in his mouth and rip his jaw apart.

-I saw it on the Chiller channel

-It’s a slasher film 

-The setting was winter in a forest, I believe there was only one cabin involved 

-Plot Spoiler! It all ended up being a dream made up by the teacher, but everything ended up happening again

-The first (and technically last) kill was a girl in a pink jacket getting caught in a bear trap

-The Final girl made it to an ice rink but no one listened as she was being killed 

-The victims are all college students 

-The killer used a variety of weapons, such as a beat trap and soccer cleats

HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"So, firstly, I have seen most of the original Japanese film, but don't really remember the details that well. So I'm not sure how much this particular part of the story differs between the two. I also can't remember if this is explained in the original, and they just decided not to put it in the remake. ALSO, I am quite stupid so this is probably more me not understanding rather than a problem with the film. 

My issue is with two pieces of info, and how they fit together: the first piece of info is that the Morgan's live on some small (?) island off the mainland. The second piece of info is that Samara is ""buried"" in a well that has since had a cabin built over it, ON the mainland. Now, from what I do remember, that cabin site is NOT on the island. I may be wrong. But this is why I'm confused.

Because in the scene that Samara's mother yeets her down the well, WHY are Samara and her mother even there? They are presumably miles from their home without the father with them (or at least, he isn't seen). There are also no cabins in this flashback scene, so you couldn't say that they're on holiday together in the cabins. Maybe they're on a walk but why come all this way for a walk when they live on a fairly nice island? And why not specify that in the film at all? 

Also, Samara is watching horses in a distant field. I know the connection here is that her mother loves horses, but why are they in this scene in particular? Those can't be the Morgan's horses because they're miles from their stable. I don't remember it ever being said that they have a second stable on the mainland, or that they travel around helping other stables. And I doubt the mother is so connected to her horses that all of them MUST be taken with her everywhere she goes.  I just don't see why the horses were included here except from to make that obvious link, for no reason? 

Can anyone explain why Samara was thrown down THIS well, while they were miles from their home for seemingly no reason at all besides the fact there's a well there? Maybe this is explained in the film and I missed it because I was being a coward and watching through my fingers, maybe it's explained in the original and the directors just decided to be lazy with the remake.

A strange woman appears in a trailer and cures the girl. The mom takes her daughter to a hospital where the doctors find no evidence of a snakebite. But the cure comes at a price... the woman has to kill someone by sunset the next day or else the little girls symptoms reappear and she dies.

Okay, so I grew up watching horror films since I was little like around five years old. Horror films was a family thing and they were scary at that time, but now these days they're not that scary nor creepy. Everything I written below is how I feel and probably missed a lot of details, but everyone has their thoughts right? Ive seen hundreds of horror films so I want to point out some things I think.

Despite not being scared to recent horror films or since after 2013 (some films were scary) the films terrifying scares, etc died down. I did watch IT and IT chapter two which I think were done amazing despite a lot of fans think about it. The designs were beautiful and right down creepy, as you would expect from a Stephan King film remake. Despite a lot of remake fails like ""The Nightmare on Elm Street"" which was more a horror and went off from the original. (Yes.. i said more horror, but if you know the originals there was also comedy so it ruined the remake) The  IT designs and story reminded me of how creepy horror films should be. Like ""The Mist"" movie. (Yes, I know its a monster film, but I consider it a special place among the horrors) Just like ""Crimson Peak"". All these films are not my all time favorite, but they're beautifuly done. How I look at it is that ""Horror"" should be more carefully done now and what we need is a new original story movie series like the original ""Friday the 13th (The remake was really good I find! ) ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"" but that doesnt stop there because ""13th Ghosts"" was an amazing movie. There is a lot of horror films that deserve more like ""Dead Silence"" which in my opinion DAMN now that horror film was creepy, as it shows a lot and tells the story perfectly! besides a killer doll like chucky (I'm not hating the Child's Play movie because I did enjoy them myself)  that film was the right way and damn good. All these films, yet now in this age (I feel like i'm talking old even though being 23) the horror genre movies seem dying down which I don't like. We need a new series and a new story, so that the horror can be revived with something new. Imagine Stephan King, Guillermo Del Toro, James Wan and Scott Derrickson come together to create a new horror universe. There is a lot of horror films I love that I did not mentioned like ""Mama"", ""Haunting in Connecticut (not 2)"", ""Amytiville Horror"", ""1408"", ""Gothika"", ""30 days of night (sequal sucks)"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""... While the most disturbing movie I seen is hands down ""Sinister"" which out of all horror movies i've seen that one was creepy, disturbing, scary and psychological creepy.  Yes, I know there is different horror genre's, but it's still good I find to point out that horror films are dying down. The most interesting and could become the most terrifying horror film could come from the thoughts of the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" because dreams can do so much between mentally and physical. Which can be psychological terrifying like ""Sinister"" in my opinion. We need a horror that strikes us all in a way. If we have a horror that makes us disturbed like ""Sinister"" and the frightning of dreams like ""The Nightmare On Elm Street"" together would be beautiful in a way, but it has to be brought together and create its own horror series. A new born terror that we horror lovers need and to revive the genre with a new continuing series!. Then again we all have different fears, but that can change because we all have dreams which is common.

HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"There's a movie I remember watching when I was a kid that has a scene that's played over and over in my head for the last 25-30 years. I'm 90% sure it was a horror movie, but it may have just been this one scene. Judging by the filming style and quality of the footage I want to say that this was a movie from the mid 80's, or possibly the late '70s. The scene in question is a Victorian era scene of a large Christmas dinner with a roasted turkey in the center of the table. All seems to be going well when suddenly the turkey's head pops out of it's body (like it had it retracted like a turtle rather than cut off). Then it jumped up and attacked one of the people at the table, scratching his face up. To my recollection, he was the only one who seemed to react to the turkey coming back to life, which makes me think this was a hallucination or maybe a dream sequence? I dunno I was a kid lol.

Unfortunately, I don't remember much else about the movie. I want to say that this scene takes place very early on in the film, and may even be the movie's pre-title sequence. I asked around a lot over the years and usually no one has any recollection of this movie, so its probably something obscure that everyone forgot about. My dad is the only person who know the scene, because I watched it with him, but that's all he remembers of it too.

Another one is about a couple getting buried in sand up to head level and is left there to drown when the tide comes in. Their spirits haunt the one who killed them and decided to kill him the same way.
I don't know if there was a third B plot but I remember at the end of the A plot the boy took one of the cut outs at the back of the comic for a voodoo doll and starts stabbing it, which ends up hurting his father.

Every year the Saturday before Halloween I do a scary movie night for family and friends.

I do 3 movies.  The first one is an old classic that has to be at least 20 years old, second is a foreign horror and the third is something made within the last two years.

For the recent movie I’m playing Midsommar.

I’m having trouble finding something for the foreign horror.  For this one I’m looking for something that is violent to keep everyone on their toes.  I don’t want to go slow burn due to Midsommar coming afterwards.

Here are some of the foreign horrors that I’ve played over the years

Audition, Let the right one in, Martyrs, Inside, Witch, Raw,  High Tension, Frontiers, Hereditary, Train to Busan, The Babadook, Goodnight Mommy, and probably a few others that I’m forgetting.

And I’m looking for some fairly recent if possible, but I can’t find any non slow burn in your face violent movies.

HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,,Sick of reading about Joker? I'd like to introduce you to a movie called SAVAGED
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"So to start this, I don't really know if this is the correct community, but I just wanted to write about it. Truth or Dare came out in 2017 and you may have heard of/seen the more popular but worse Truth or Dare that came out in 2018, check out Truth or Dare 2017 on Netflix to get full context, but I'm gonna give an overview here, and yes there's obviously gonna be spoilers. 

To start, we're introduced to 5 characters and we meet 3 others later; First is Tyler, the med school student and the boyfriend of Alex, the smart girl and these two are just some lovebirds, how adorable. Also in their car is Maddy, Alex's best friend. The scene then transitions to Luke, the athlete driving with his girlfriend Jessie, who is meeting the group. Luke says they're meeting his friend group in a haunted house that voyeuristic Carter rented out for a Halloween fun time. All 5 friends arrive at the house to find Carter chilling on the front steps recording them and making sex jokes, with another car arriving carrying comic relief Holt and mean girl Addison. They all settle into this house where Carter explains that 30 years ago, 7 teens played Truth or Dare and all but 1 died in the house, and the group, like fucking dipshits, decides to play Truth or Dare. The game starts off normal until Maddy picks up a truth card saying did you sleep with Tyler, and she had to admit the truth. Tyler and Alex both get pissed and storm off, as well as Maddy, until Tyler comes back to yell at Carter, when Tyler picks up a card that says ""Put your hand on the hot stove"". Tyler doesn't, thinking it's just a stupid card Carter wrote, when a force pulls his hand to the stove, his hand gets burned and flesh tears off. Tyler is let go eventually, the group comes to help him, and Holt and Luke confront Carter about what the hell is going on, when the TV explains the games rules; Three rounds, 48 hours, don't do the dare or lie on a truth, suffer the consequences. The group takes their turns getting dares, such as Jessie having to eat Tyler's burnt flesh and Holt having to grab exposed electrical wires (he's saved), until Addison gets a truth card during her mental breakdown that says ""Are you an addict"", and this is shown to be true from some foreshadowing earlier where we watch Addison pop some pills. She lies through the whole thing, leaves, and then gets impaled on a sharp pipe, killing her swiftly. The group head back to their college campus where we see Carter chilling in his room looking at memories of Addison, when his camera starts moving on its own. He moves it to his bed where he sees a Carrie-like Addison writing in blood for Carter to hang himself for 2 minutes as his dare. Carter doesn't and screams for help until it's too late, and he gets hung by the demon possessing the game, just as Tyler, Holt, Maddy, and Alex get there. Alex does research on the game to find the survivor and ask her for advice, and the survivor tells her that the group needs to share the dares to survive and also that the game must finish at the house. The scene ends and goes to Luke and Jessie sitting in Luke's room when Luke gets his dare for round 2, saying he must rob a gas station, and giving Luke a complimentary gun. Luke and Jessie head to a gas station. Luke pulls out his gun, but while he's looking at Jessie, the cashier pulls out a shotgun, Luke tries to grab something to complete the dare, and gets shot in the stomach in the process. Jessie starts frantically driving, calls Alex, and Alex explains what she heard from the survivor, and they all meet at the house where they started playing. They go inside where Tyler gets the next dare, which is to drink a goblet of poison, but the group outsmarts the game by drinking soda, splitting the poison, and puking all the poison back up, and they survived. The next was to pull out two teeth which again the group easily accomplishes. Everything goes to hell when they get tasked to play Russian Roulette. Alex shoots herself with blanks twice, and Maddy goes to shoot herself when Tyler takes the gun and turns it on himself, and gets a bullet in the head, and Tyler dies. Holt goes to the bathroom to cool off when he gets his dare saying he has to get run over by a car. Holt runs back down to the group to explain that he was involved in a hit and run, and that he needs to get run over, Jessie gets in her car to run him over but her car wont start, and Maddy doesn't get Tyler's keys until Holt is getting run over by the demon controlling the car, and Holt dies. Alex explains that the game plays off of fear, obsessions, and secrets, such as Holt getting run over or Jessie's next dare, which involves her having to get chained to a pipe, which she refuses because there are roaches and Jessie is incredibly scared of roaches. Jessie dies when an army of roaches swarms her and eat her alive. Round 3 starts with just Alex and Maddy left, when they both get assigned to take off 7 living body parts. In an incredibly gruesome scene, we watch these girls take off fingernails, toenails, toes, fingers, earlobes, and even a whole foot, when Alex gets in her car to start driving to the hospital to get her and Maddy's body parts sewn back on when the GPS configures to say ""Kill her"", which to the audience is implied to be Maddy, but throughout the movie, an inference can be made that Alex is pregnant and it must be because if Maddy had died in Russian Roulette like she was supposed to, Alex couldn't kill her, so the game is talking about Alex's unborn daughter. Alex loses it, and heads straight for a tree, when the scene cuts to black and you're supposed to think they both died but nope, they both breathed at the end (thank you Netflix subtitles), and the movie ends, ROLL CREDITS.

Now that was just your context, now time for how everyone could have lived. Starting off in Round 1, if Addison had just admitted she was an addict, she would have lived. Carter's next dare involved hanging himself, and logically, since the house had locked shut when the game started and only unlocked when Addison died, Carter would get that dare when he was still surrounded by his friends, so Carter could have hung for 2 minutes and then be resuscitated by med school student Tyler and lived. Luke would have survived by going with his friends since in this universe they would have all been stuck in the house, and when he went to rob the gas station, have his friends go behind the counter so the cashier doesn't try anything. Now they're all back in the house when they have to get teeth pulled and play Russian Roulette and here someone must die. Playing legitimately, Alex would have shot, then Maddy, then Tyler, and then Jessie, since that was the order they got their dares in in the first round, so Jessie would have died either way. Holt was smart originally by trying to get his foot run over but the car wouldn't start, he went to check the engine to fix it, got his hand caught and dragged down the street, and ultimately run over, but in this universe, only Jessie would be dead. This also means that Carter and Addison would have still had their cars, so 3 other cars are in play besides Jessie's, thus Holt would have survived by getting his foot run over. Also in this universe, since Jessie is dead before she got her roach dare, that dare wouldn't exist, so they would move to round 3 once Holt got his foot run over. Round 3 only had two dares and I can't go adding dares to something so I'll just continue. The 7 body parts, everyone donates a body part, and what the dare specified was whole body parts, not different body parts, so since 7 people are alive, everyone could have given up 1 fingernail or toenail as a least painful option. Finally, Alex's dare about having to kill her unborn baby, she just repeats what she did in the original version, since she didn't die, she just got injured. 

And that ladies and gentlemen, is how almost everyone could have survived Truth or Dare (2017), go check out this movie on Netflix, it is really good",How almost everyone could have survived Truth or Dare (2017)

The 2018 version one-ups the gore, kills, and dark nature of the original, and thank the lord they dropped the storyline where Laurie is Michael’s sister, via a carefully placed line by one of the kids in the beginning.

HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,So I just watched the dark tower. In one scene the characters pass an amusement part and a sign says pennywise the dancing clown then a monster that looks like a crab spider thing lures out Eddie by using allusions of his father before trying to eat him. I am wondering if this is either pennywise or another of that species. In the book when the adult losers kill it they discovered it was pregnant so there are more of the deadlight species. So what do you think? Was that it or something else?,Dark tower IT monster?
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"Hi!

I'm setting up my list for horror movies to watch this Halloween (one very day)

I already have a bunch I own (the whole Halloween series) and others I've already decided I'm gonna watch, but there's a few other movies I'm interested in on Netflix.

Are any of these films any good? Or do any of you have suggestions for better films on Netflix (US) I could watch?

To be clear, there's a lot of movies on Netflix that are either already on my list or I've already seen.

Thank you!",Halloween Horror Movie list HELP!

HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,Hey folks! I request you to please recommend me some horror movies worth watching.,Recommendations
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"I'm trying to find a horror movie Id seen about 10 years ago, it was about abunch of people on a bus going to this town, only to realize everyone in the town is sadistic murders, they put them into a show in the basement and while people clap and cheer as they die. One of them gets a tube pushed into his mouth and they pump poop into him until he explodes. Anyone know what movie this is?",UK Horror movie about a redneck town that murders a group of people?
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,,"Help me find the movie that this is from, I saw this tattoo of a person showing off their horror themed tattoos seeing this reminded me of the movie, but I can’t remember the name of it. Thanks in advance!"
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"I quite often find myself puzzled by people who choose to waste their money and time to watch a scary movie. Or more importantly why do people spend their time producing such garbage? I can see how romantic movies even if they are bad could function as ""feel good"" movies and therefore make a profit.

I filter out all movies rated 0-3 out of 10...and I get scary movies and romantic manure. I see how and why the romcom stuff makes sense but im truly puzzled by the scary movie stuff.

So I figured maybe I am just missing something and that something could be that I have been just desensitize to horror/scary stuff by consuming uncanny amount of videogames and ""tv"". 

Im 30y old now. I started playing videogames when I was 4y old and as a kid I could watch whatever I wanted from TV even the late late stuff.

That means I remember watching masterpieces like 1997 Cube. That stuff kept me up that night and I rememer I was scared stiff watching it. There were so many good horror movies that kept me up for days. 

Movies that rely on building fake tention and scares have never really been my thing. I have been to movies with my buddys where I just have to walk out to keep my cool after witnessing a 1minute tention build to get a scare resolution that is just a gdm rat.

I remember playing Doom3 for the first time and I found that game horrifying. I had to take serious breaks just to keep going. Now I can finish the whole game in just hours without breaking a sweat. I remember playing Silent Hill series close to that time and it was not a big struggle mentally. But then I talked to other people who also played both and they found Doom3 ez and silent hill hard. It really puzzled me. Essentially the more I was exposed to ""scary stuff"" the easier it was to digest and my reviews on content were highly affected by the order in which I consumed them.

Quite recently I watched ""A quiet place"". I struggled to see what other people saw. It was not horrifying nor scary...but just a neat idea. Infact I found myself boored several times looking for a remote to skip ahead just to realise im watching it on the big screen. I was just thinking I wish I had seen that when I was a kid, that would have been awsome maybe. 

This made me wonder how many people actually just grow out of getting scared easily? Because of this I remember loving some really shit movies at the time that I would absolutely hate today.

So does that just mean that some grownups never grow out of bad scary movies?",Why do you think there are so many low rated scary movies?
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,,I always loved the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark series and now there's a documentary about them!!!
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"For the record I loved it, but opinions on this movie vary widely.  Some critics despised it, while others think it was ahead of its time.  The director, Brian Yuzna, was the producer of the Re-Animator films, and it definitely has the same dark humor those movies had.

If you haven't seen it you might give it a chance.  Oh, and I also recommend NOT reading the synopsis on Wikipedia (or any other site) before doing so.",Society (1989): Classic Horror or Failure?

HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,,My horror collection
HorrorMoviesONLY,sub,"This is the simplest way to explain the movie The Wailing is through the Fisherman catching fish. The fish are the people of the village including Jong-Goo and through Jong Goo, the City Shaman was also caught. The Forest Shaman/Jap is the bait. The Fisherman/demon is the white woman. The could have been the Champion was Jong Goo's nephew. The game is about fishing. There is no certain target whoever takes the bait is a good as dead just as it was mentioned by the City Shaman. The people in the village including Jong Goo easily believed that the Jap/forest shaman is the demon doing all the evil in their village. Everybody talks about the japs and all things or evidence points to him. Where in fact, the Jap/forest shaman was the one trying to fight the demon/white woman preventing dead bodies to be possess. This is exactly what the demon/white woman has been doing all along. Even the City Shaman was mislead and was used to destroy the jap/forest shaman when he did a death hex all because Jong Goo has already taken the bait believing the jap/forest shaman was the demon. When the City Shaman asked Jong Goo if he disturb anyone and all he can think of was the Jap/forest shaman. The Jap/forest shaman and the City Shaman are no match against the white woman/demon even if the joined together. Remember, the white woman/demon was just using the Jap/forest shaman as the bait for the people in the village and even the City Shaman took the bait himself. As the scripture says, ""The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy"" John 10:10 That is exactly the character of the white woman/demon. The could have been the Champion was Jong Goo's Nephew. If you notice, he was the only who prayed and doubted that the Jap/forest shaman was the demon. He was the only one who did not take the bait however, he failed to stand up and have courage. When he did, it was too late. The Jap/forest shaman was already possess by the white woman. At the end of the movie, it was him who was facing the demon in the cave. He was the only one legitimate to defeat the demon because only the light of God can defeat darkness. You need unwavering faith and courage.

horror,sub,"Hello fellow ARG enthusiasts!

As the title plainly states, I am currently writing a story (in fact multiple stories) I believe would be great for an interactive alternate reality game. I've been a fan of watching ARG's for years but never attempted to make one before, but am also very interested in seeing what me and a group of like-minded people could conjure up.

Unfortunately I can't outright state what the story is going to be about (for obvious reasons), but for anyone interested I would be happy to discuss it through DM's. What I can say about one of the stories is it will involve the use of breaking codes but not for the sake of edginess (or creep factors) but rather out of necessity for the protagonist to communicate with the outside word without being detected by something unable to break codes (this is something I can elaborate on further in the DM's). For both of my stories, I am hoping to use some visual effects to further enhance the realism (something I myself have no experience creating but have some great ideas in mind for what these effects might look like). I do want to be able to make accommodations for these effects as well, so any feedback on the difficulty of what I'm asking for would be much appreciated!

First and foremost, this is supposed to be a collaborative effort! I need people willing to have regularly scheduled chats with myself to help craft the story into a reality, and I do not really want to necessarily be the protagonist or the ""leader"" in this effort either. I'm just a writer with an idea, and that idea can't become a reality without other peoples input and hard work along with me. So I want this project to become just as much yours as it is mine.

Secondly, as I stated before, I Am a writer. Not a filmmaker (though I am capable), nor a video editor, nor a visual effects specialist. I am a musician and do have some great connections to make some cool sound effects, but that's about as much as I can help in that regard. I do however have experience writing short stories, research papers, and investigative journalism, so my attention to detail within the crafting of a compelling story is quite good (if I were to toot my own horn). So I'd imagine my main role within creating this ARG would be the basic story and working out a more detailed timeline of events for a set of characters.

So now that I've gotten all of that out of the way, I would like to list off the things/people I am looking for and what their roles within this potential ARG might be:

* CGI &amp; Visual Effects: Someone who is capable of making things appear on screen that can fool the untrained, and to a certain extend trained eye as well, into believing what they are seeing on screen is real. Even if they know it isn't. The best webseries and ARG's know when to leave it up to your imagination and when to show something onscreen for the greatest dramatic effect. I want this series to be able to both show and tell it's story. These stories might also involve the use of codes, so creating codes within certain visual effects may be a necessity as well.
* Video Editor: Although I have a basic familiarity with video editing, I am painfully aware my ideas for great editing exceed my own abilities in the field. That is why I am looking for someone who has a flair for knowing when to cut and when to linger on a shot. Someone who is capable of creating great visual transitions between scenes and an over all better understanding of their editing software than myself. I am a writer and have no interest in learning how to do cool editing tricks, but I do enjoy writing stories that necessitate good editing skills and want to work with some great editors to put their skills to good use!
* Social Media Gurus: I know this sounds like a kinda weird role, but the job essentially entails knowing how to create websites, a traceable breadcrumb trail of clues scattered throughout social media platforms, as well as stimulating user interaction within the story.
* Actors: I am capable of acting, though I wouldn't dare call myself an actor. I do have a bit of a higher voice which is good for certain roles but a detriment over all. I also look quite young for my age which, to me, lowers the realism of the stories I want to tell. So I am looking for people with some decent acting chops that know how to go beyond the basic acting tricks you learn like the ""thousand yard stare"" and can deliver how real people talk, with imperfections, yet a genuine talent for the right inflections. I am also looking for people who have a deeper voice along with a more older looking complexion for the antagonist and mysterious character roles. Other nationalities besides American/English are also welcome but the main language of this series must be in English (although other languages could be used in an interesting way but cannot be the main spoken language within the series). One of these stories does not actually require the real voice of the protagonist, so some acting does involve non-verbal communication.
* Writer's Room / Game Maker's Group: Anybody from any of the previous roles that is interested in helping flesh out the story with myself. This would involve taking the concepts and ideas we have and turning them into specific episodic story beats, writing scripts for the episodes, and consistent discussions about the whens and wheres to reveal information as well as how said information is going to be revealed. I don't want to be the only one in charge of the creation of this story. In my eyes, collaborative efforts always yield the best fruit, so I want to work with other writers on how to expand and further enhance my story ideas as well as input their own ideas into this story. I can see my ideas having a lot of potential for many different people to put their own unique spin on, and that's exactly what I want to encourage.

Hey, you made it to the end... Congratulations! If you are a person who has any of the talents listed above and/or are interested in hearing more, please feel free to up-vote this, comment your talents, and DM me with your skills, questions, or general intrigue and I will try and get back to you at my earliest convenience. I might ask you to share some of your previous work to get a grasp on your skills, but understand this comes with the exchange of getting to know more about the stories I've written. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear from some of you soon!","Writer Looking to Create Horror ARG: In Need of Video Editors, Visual Effects, Social Media Gurus, and More!"

I'm posting this here because it's a parody of horror movies, if this isn't the right place then I'll find somewhere else, anyways imma try to recollect my thoughts.

Don't get me wrong, some parts were funny. Shorty is hilarious as always, every scene with the dude with the crooked hand were the best imo, and the cat fight scene was great. That being said the lows definitely outnumber the highs. It had much more truly disgusting scenes than the original and all of them involved sex in one way or another. It got stale and repetitive after the dream sequence.

The first movie also had a nasty sex scene but there was only 1 so you didn't know what to expect from it and thus the surprise was much more effective than the dozens of sex scenes in this one.

The film begins with some drug dealers picking up drugs from a mortician ( Clarence Williams), but instead of giving the drugs he tells em stories of several bodies in the mortuary;

Tale 1; involves a bunch of racist cops and new black cops first day on the job

Tale 2; involves a teacher trying to help a young black boy who comes to school everyday with bruises, when asked who did it he simply replies, 'the monster' ( this tale is quite possible one of my favorite horror movie segments of all time)

Tale 3: Follows the story of a racist who is running for governor who has just purchased a property of a slave owner ( good story but imo the weakest of all the tales)

Tale 4: Follows a violent gangbanger who is offered to be released if he takes part in a reformation experiment ( the ending to this one is really deep)

# The consequences of gaslighting your girlfriend

Jesus fucking Christ. I haven't seen a movie go for broke on the whole ""asshole boyfriend"" trope since [***White Settlers***](https://vocal.media/horror/reed-alexander-s-horror-review-of-the-blood-lands-2014) (2014). At least that asshole showed some growth. This prick doubled down at every moment of the movie. He goes from gaslighting his girlfriend Dani (played by Florence Pugh), to stringing along their relationship rather than dumping her, to using Dani's sister's suicide as a weapon, to being completely unsupportive as a boyfriend, to stealing a thesis from someone who is supposed to be a friend, to eye-fucking ever woman in sight. The list goes on and fucking on. GOD! How hard do you have to drive home the guy being an asshole?

I complain about this tons of my reviews. Writing contemptible characters as the protagonists isn't a deal breaker, but it sort of sets a poor tone for the movie. We can't empathy with the struggles of the protagonist if we're constantly rooting for them to get killed. I'm all for the catharsis of watching some asshole get his comeuppance, but if there was any way to empathize with him at all, the statement would be far more powerful.

That being said, after the first 10 damn minutes of the movie, you're just hoping something bad will happen to this prick and his obnoxious hetero boyfriend. The only one you end up feeling remotely sorry for is Josh (played by William Jackson Harper). He was just trying to write a fucking thesis, and while he can be a bit of an asshole too, it's just because he's driven. That, and the asshole male lead constantly pushes him.

However, this movie has a lot going for it outside of the contemptible characters. That cinematography is just spellbinding and almost contrary to what typically makes great horror cinematography. This movie is bright, colorful and has an amazing sense of melancholy. While everything is just slightly off and even a little sinister, it's always just north of creepy, and even inviting.

I don't know who wrote the story for this, but it's almost like an adventure in cult anthropology. The detail and mythos that goes into this cult and their behaviors are so damn developed, it's flat out fascinating. I made a similar comment about this style of writing in my review of [***Black Mountain Side***](https://vocal.media/horror/reed-alexander-s-horror-review-of-black-mountain-side-2014) (2014). This level of plot development might be a bit too smart for most horror fans. It's kinda good that the rest of the plot is dumb simple, or it could make the plot muddy.

I was worried that this movie was going to be just another take on *The Wicker Man* (1973) and (2006). However, other than the basic premise, this movie is nothing like *Wicker Man*. *Wicker Man* just didn't put this level of detail into the setting, and it was more of a faux murder mystery than an anthropological investigation into a cult.

I do recommend *Midsommar*, even if just for how fascinating the plot is. It's not a 'must watch,' it might not even make it on to my 'All Time Top Horror List,' but its pretty good for Horror Heads and general adult audiences alike.

# SPOILERS!!!

I'm not even sure if it's a spoiler to say these characters were selected by the cult as a sacrifice. That was pretty much how the whole movie was billed, and most went into it expecting *The Wicker Man* (1973) at best, and *The Wicker Man* (2006) at worst [**#notthebees**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotTheBees).

But again, the devil's in the details of this movie and the cult. The cult was just targeting the three men. Dani gets dragged in almost completely by accident, because her boyfriend bluffed and invited her along, expecting her to say no. This just showcases one of many circumstances where the male lead is a contemptible prick. He didn't want her to go, was fully intending on cheating on her while he was away. He only invited her because she recently suffered the loss of her sister, and he didn't want to look like he was abandoning her, when that was fully what he was intending on doing. His lack of emotional support just sucks Dani in because she's in a vulnerable state so she decides to join him.

I mean, can you get any more calloused? The woman's sister just killed herself AND her parents, in part because this guy was constantly driving a wedge between them. And it never occurs to him to maybe stick around or that she'd want to stay with him because she needs the support through this part of her life.

So can anyone guess how the movie ends? If you guessed the asshole boyfriend dies, you have a firm grasp on why the ""asshole boyfriend"" is even a trope. But they don't just make Dani some final girl, hell no, she gets crowned May Queen and joins the cult as their leader, literally selecting her asshole boyfriend as the final sacrifice. That'll fucking teach the prick.

Anyway, totally worth a watch.

For me it's  Noroi: The Curse. Every time I see someone post about this movie I think back to how bored I was when I saw it for the first time. I generally enjoy found footage movies, and Japanese horror too, so I thought I would love this movie. But for some reason I was not into it. I am, however, open to seeing it again with more of an open mind. Maybe I missed something all those years ago when I saw it. Tastes change as well. Perhaps I will like it.

horror,sub,"And I say American because if you’ve ever watched a Japanese horror movie they don’t seem to rely too much on CGI and jump scares.  It’s mostly buildup, suspense and psychological. By the time a ghost shows up, you are thoroughly freaked out. And the ghost doesn’t jump out or make a scary face.  It just walks across the hall or is peeking at you from around a corner.

American horror from the 60s and 70s were like that.  The Exorcist hardly had any jump scares at all.  The famous Psycho scene is a perfect example of real horror.   Someone slowly walking into a bathroom while you are showering.  The classic movies focused heavily on the characters and their mental torment, and the audience felt it with them.

Today, most horror is almost entirely CGI and/or relies on jump scares and an over abundance of LOUD NOISES.  For example.  Grave Encounters.  What started as a solid found footage horror flick with great atmosphere and buildup quickly dissolved into standard trope and cliche demon faces.  Even implied some sort of devil worship.

But is that what works for audiences today?  Every now and then a gem like Hereditary comes out which was a great horror movie.  But most of the time it’s crap like the Marilyn Manson nun from Conjuring. And people think that’s scary.  Will American horror ever go back to character, atmosphere and suspense?",Is it possible to make a good American Horror movie without relying on jump scares and loud noises?

horror,sub,"Long post.

The theme of Alice being someone no-one really knows is brought up time and time again. 

First of all her mother doesn't know her which is actually made explicitly clear but then neither does her boyfriend, her friends, father or brother. In fact, her best friend says something to the effect of ""maybe we all knew a different Ally"".    

This continues in her death. Her family tries to uncover what happened but they don't really succeed. Think about it, what don't we know: 

 1) How she died. We are never told and its never explained how she died. She was swimming in a lake where the water was completely still, there's no mention of any investigation over her death. It actually struck me straight away, you'd usually expect some suspicion, some lines of inquiry but there's nothing. That seems so crucial but its just never addressed.

2) What the nature of the relationship between Alice and her neighbors was. Yet again this investigation dries up and then we're just supposed to accept that its all done and no longer a concern.

3) Why was she seeing apparitions of her death and not just her, she literally filmed the apparition and its confirmed to be her. Its just baffling how downplayed this is in the movie, they literally have footage of a girls own ghost taken at the time she was still alive. We get back to back shots of her corpse and this photo and its evidently her but apparently no one really cares.   There's even more in the story which is left somewhat ambiguous like why she really buried her jewelry but fundamentally we don't actually know anything about her either. We aren't told anything specific about her personality other than the fact she liked to keep secrets. Everything that is said about her is just stuff that people observed before her death and its very general like ""she was well liked"".   

Right at the end of the movie we have a scene which I think emphasizes this very much and also makes a point of the fact Alice is still not resting and in fact she is just being forgotten about yet again, her mysteries continuing. June goes back for one more meeting with Ray, in this scene we have Alice's meeting spliced in between.   

It is heavily implied that in her meeting Alice was seeing the future (as she apparently has the power to do). Alice says someone is coming to her door, June says she's going towards Alice's door. Ray tells June to go inside and she does reluctantly, Alice says her mother has come into the room. Ray asks Alice what her mother is saying, she says she's not saying anything, she doesn't know I'm here. Ray asks June what's in the room, she says nothing. Alice says her mother is leaving, June wakes up and looks at Ray.   

Straight after this scene we have the family leaving the house and putting the past (and Alice) behind them. They say the house feels calm, that they can be a family again and just generally imply they're moving on. We even see her brother and mother sitting on the bench in their garden laughing, the same one Alice's ghost appears on in the photo. After this we have a series of photos showing that Alice was watching them the entire time but no-one noticed these in the videos or pictures.   

The only things anyone noticed were forgeries, her brother at the lake (not her), other people in the footage, but they never noticed her. No one knows this girl seemingly, she was well liked and loved (supposedly) and yet no-one knows a damn thing about her and no-one seems to care all that much. Sure her family are upset overall and get angry/sad when they find the footage of her fucking the neighbors. They wonder about why its there but not really. They don't try to look for the truth, they just want to satisfy their own sense of moving past it.   

The father does this straight away with work and Alice literally confronts him as a ghost to try to get him to look into it more, which somewhat catalyses the story but then it still ends unsatisfying.  No-one ever seems to look for the truth in this movie. Everything connected with Alice is completely unsolved and yet everyone just moves on like it has been solved. Sure, we find out some more information about her but we still don't really know who she is or what happened to her. We just know a bit more about the events leading up to her death.  

Its heavily implied, by the ending of the movie, that Alice still isn't at rest and that she's actually just been forgotten or the family have moved on without her. Part of that is moving from the house which also gives the impression she will just remain in the house waiting for someone to actually solve her death.   Now look, I think this could be just bad writing or it not being fully formulated before it was finished I don't know. But there really is so much ambiguity about her death and we never find out anything about it. We find out she kept secrets, had sex with her neighbor, buried some stuff and saw visions of her own death. What does that actually tell us about her death?  

Nothing and yet the film ends and the family move on. Seems to me the whole point of the movie was Alice trying to figure out why/how she was going to die and prevent it (burying her stuff, going to the medium etc.) and then dying anyway. Then she tries to haunt her family so they'll find out but they ignore her and move on.  

Also, I noticed it seems like there's a somewhat abandoned, or just extremely vague, implication that her brother murdered her. He's the last one to be with her, in the water where she died, he mysteriously gets bruises all over himself at one point and this is never explained (was she attacking him for what he'd done?). He doctors the footage for his family, which is clearly something he plans as he starts getting more into photography right after her death. Whatever the reason is for this, or why he would want to be able to do it or to convince his family they were being haunted he also doesn't see the real haunting that is occurring in the photos.  

Think about what you actually watched and it just feels kind of empty to me. Way more questions are posed than that are answered and yet we're supposed to accept that everything is finished in the families eyes yet clearly its not from the ending.   Even the movie seems self-aware that the mystery is still yet to be solved (Alice remaining in the house) and yet the family move on as if it is. If anything this movie just gives the horrible message that if you die under extremely mysterious circumstances no one, not even your own family, will care enough to try and figure it out before running away from where it all happened. The real horror, for me, is the idea that as individuals we may never be truly known by others while we're alive, even if we're well-liked. After our deaths, people may realize they never truly knew us, but the living are so caught up with moving forward in life that they can't be bothered to care. 

I think a lot of the movie is about being alone and unknown in life and in death.",Just rewatched Lake Mungo and found the general theme of being ignored/not known more depressing than scary.

Don't get me wrong, some parts were funny. Shorty is hilarious as always, every scene with the dude with the crooked hand were the best imo, and the cat fight scene was great. That being said the lows definitely outnumber the highs. It had much more truly disgusting scenes than the original and all of them involved sex in one way or another. It got stale and repetitive after the dream sequence.

The first movie also had a nasty sex scene but there was only 1 so you didn't know what to expect from it and thus the surprise was much more effective than the dozens of sex scenes in this one.

The film begins with some drug dealers picking up drugs from a mortician ( Clarence Williams), but instead of giving the drugs he tells em stories of several bodies in the mortuary;

Tale 1; involves a bunch of racist cops and new black cops first day on the job

Tale 2; involves a teacher trying to help a young black boy who comes to school everyday with bruises, when asked who did it he simply replies, 'the monster' ( this tale is quite possible one of my favorite horror movie segments of all time)

Tale 3: Follows the story of a racist who is running for governor who has just purchased a property of a slave owner ( good story but imo the weakest of all the tales)

Tale 4: Follows a violent gangbanger who is offered to be released if he takes part in a reformation experiment ( the ending to this one is really deep)

I complain about this tons of my reviews. Writing contemptible characters as the protagonists isn't a deal breaker, but it sort of sets a poor tone for the movie. We can't empathy with the struggles of the protagonist if we're constantly rooting for them to get killed. I'm all for the catharsis of watching some asshole get his comeuppance, but if there was any way to empathize with him at all, the statement would be far more powerful.

That being said, after the first 10 damn minutes of the movie, you're just hoping something bad will happen to this prick and his obnoxious hetero boyfriend. The only one you end up feeling remotely sorry for is Josh (played by William Jackson Harper). He was just trying to write a fucking thesis, and while he can be a bit of an asshole too, it's just because he's driven. That, and the asshole male lead constantly pushes him.

However, this movie has a lot going for it outside of the contemptible characters. That cinematography is just spellbinding and almost contrary to what typically makes great horror cinematography. This movie is bright, colorful and has an amazing sense of melancholy. While everything is just slightly off and even a little sinister, it's always just north of creepy, and even inviting.

I don't know who wrote the story for this, but it's almost like an adventure in cult anthropology. The detail and mythos that goes into this cult and their behaviors are so damn developed, it's flat out fascinating. I made a similar comment about this style of writing in my review of [***Black Mountain Side***](https://vocal.media/horror/reed-alexander-s-horror-review-of-black-mountain-side-2014) (2014). This level of plot development might be a bit too smart for most horror fans. It's kinda good that the rest of the plot is dumb simple, or it could make the plot muddy.

I was worried that this movie was going to be just another take on *The Wicker Man* (1973) and (2006). However, other than the basic premise, this movie is nothing like *Wicker Man*. *Wicker Man* just didn't put this level of detail into the setting, and it was more of a faux murder mystery than an anthropological investigation into a cult.

I do recommend *Midsommar*, even if just for how fascinating the plot is. It's not a 'must watch,' it might not even make it on to my 'All Time Top Horror List,' but its pretty good for Horror Heads and general adult audiences alike.

# SPOILERS!!!

I'm not even sure if it's a spoiler to say these characters were selected by the cult as a sacrifice. That was pretty much how the whole movie was billed, and most went into it expecting *The Wicker Man* (1973) at best, and *The Wicker Man* (2006) at worst [**#notthebees**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotTheBees).

But again, the devil's in the details of this movie and the cult. The cult was just targeting the three men. Dani gets dragged in almost completely by accident, because her boyfriend bluffed and invited her along, expecting her to say no. This just showcases one of many circumstances where the male lead is a contemptible prick. He didn't want her to go, was fully intending on cheating on her while he was away. He only invited her because she recently suffered the loss of her sister, and he didn't want to look like he was abandoning her, when that was fully what he was intending on doing. His lack of emotional support just sucks Dani in because she's in a vulnerable state so she decides to join him.

I mean, can you get any more calloused? The woman's sister just killed herself AND her parents, in part because this guy was constantly driving a wedge between them. And it never occurs to him to maybe stick around or that she'd want to stay with him because she needs the support through this part of her life.

So can anyone guess how the movie ends? If you guessed the asshole boyfriend dies, you have a firm grasp on why the ""asshole boyfriend"" is even a trope. But they don't just make Dani some final girl, hell no, she gets crowned May Queen and joins the cult as their leader, literally selecting her asshole boyfriend as the final sacrifice. That'll fucking teach the prick.

Anyway, totally worth a watch.

horror,sub,"And I say American because if you’ve ever watched a Japanese horror movie they don’t seem to rely too much on CGI and jump scares.  It’s mostly buildup, suspense and psychological. By the time a ghost shows up, you are thoroughly freaked out. And the ghost doesn’t jump out or make a scary face.  It just walks across the hall or is peeking at you from around a corner.

American horror from the 60s and 70s were like that.  The Exorcist hardly had any jump scares at all.  The famous Psycho scene is a perfect example of real horror.   Someone slowly walking into a bathroom while you are showering.  The classic movies focused heavily on the characters and their mental torment, and the audience felt it with them.

Today, most horror is almost entirely CGI and/or relies on jump scares and an over abundance of LOUD NOISES.  For example.  Grave Encounters.  What started as a solid found footage horror flick with great atmosphere and buildup quickly dissolved into standard trope and cliche demon faces.  Even implied some sort of devil worship.

But is that what works for audiences today?  Every now and then a gem like Hereditary comes out which was a great horror movie.  But most of the time it’s crap like the Marilyn Manson nun from Conjuring. And people think that’s scary.  Will American horror ever go back to character, atmosphere and suspense?",Is it possible to make a good American Horror movie without relying on jump scares and loud noises?

horror,sub,"Long post.

The theme of Alice being someone no-one really knows is brought up time and time again. 

First of all her mother doesn't know her which is actually made explicitly clear but then neither does her boyfriend, her friends, father or brother. In fact, her best friend says something to the effect of ""maybe we all knew a different Ally"".    

This continues in her death. Her family tries to uncover what happened but they don't really succeed. Think about it, what don't we know: 

 1) How she died. We are never told and its never explained how she died. She was swimming in a lake where the water was completely still, there's no mention of any investigation over her death. It actually struck me straight away, you'd usually expect some suspicion, some lines of inquiry but there's nothing. That seems so crucial but its just never addressed.

2) What the nature of the relationship between Alice and her neighbors was. Yet again this investigation dries up and then we're just supposed to accept that its all done and no longer a concern.

3) Why was she seeing apparitions of her death and not just her, she literally filmed the apparition and its confirmed to be her. Its just baffling how downplayed this is in the movie, they literally have footage of a girls own ghost taken at the time she was still alive. We get back to back shots of her corpse and this photo and its evidently her but apparently no one really cares.   There's even more in the story which is left somewhat ambiguous like why she really buried her jewelry but fundamentally we don't actually know anything about her either. We aren't told anything specific about her personality other than the fact she liked to keep secrets. Everything that is said about her is just stuff that people observed before her death and its very general like ""she was well liked"".   

Right at the end of the movie we have a scene which I think emphasizes this very much and also makes a point of the fact Alice is still not resting and in fact she is just being forgotten about yet again, her mysteries continuing. June goes back for one more meeting with Ray, in this scene we have Alice's meeting spliced in between.   

It is heavily implied that in her meeting Alice was seeing the future (as she apparently has the power to do). Alice says someone is coming to her door, June says she's going towards Alice's door. Ray tells June to go inside and she does reluctantly, Alice says her mother has come into the room. Ray asks Alice what her mother is saying, she says she's not saying anything, she doesn't know I'm here. Ray asks June what's in the room, she says nothing. Alice says her mother is leaving, June wakes up and looks at Ray.   

Straight after this scene we have the family leaving the house and putting the past (and Alice) behind them. They say the house feels calm, that they can be a family again and just generally imply they're moving on. We even see her brother and mother sitting on the bench in their garden laughing, the same one Alice's ghost appears on in the photo. After this we have a series of photos showing that Alice was watching them the entire time but no-one noticed these in the videos or pictures.   

The only things anyone noticed were forgeries, her brother at the lake (not her), other people in the footage, but they never noticed her. No one knows this girl seemingly, she was well liked and loved (supposedly) and yet no-one knows a damn thing about her and no-one seems to care all that much. Sure her family are upset overall and get angry/sad when they find the footage of her fucking the neighbors. They wonder about why its there but not really. They don't try to look for the truth, they just want to satisfy their own sense of moving past it.   

The father does this straight away with work and Alice literally confronts him as a ghost to try to get him to look into it more, which somewhat catalyses the story but then it still ends unsatisfying.  No-one ever seems to look for the truth in this movie. Everything connected with Alice is completely unsolved and yet everyone just moves on like it has been solved. Sure, we find out some more information about her but we still don't really know who she is or what happened to her. We just know a bit more about the events leading up to her death.  

Its heavily implied, by the ending of the movie, that Alice still isn't at rest and that she's actually just been forgotten or the family have moved on without her. Part of that is moving from the house which also gives the impression she will just remain in the house waiting for someone to actually solve her death.   Now look, I think this could be just bad writing or it not being fully formulated before it was finished I don't know. But there really is so much ambiguity about her death and we never find out anything about it. We find out she kept secrets, had sex with her neighbor, buried some stuff and saw visions of her own death. What does that actually tell us about her death?  

Nothing and yet the film ends and the family move on. Seems to me the whole point of the movie was Alice trying to figure out why/how she was going to die and prevent it (burying her stuff, going to the medium etc.) and then dying anyway. Then she tries to haunt her family so they'll find out but they ignore her and move on.  

Also, I noticed it seems like there's a somewhat abandoned, or just extremely vague, implication that her brother murdered her. He's the last one to be with her, in the water where she died, he mysteriously gets bruises all over himself at one point and this is never explained (was she attacking him for what he'd done?). He doctors the footage for his family, which is clearly something he plans as he starts getting more into photography right after her death. Whatever the reason is for this, or why he would want to be able to do it or to convince his family they were being haunted he also doesn't see the real haunting that is occurring in the photos.  

Think about what you actually watched and it just feels kind of empty to me. Way more questions are posed than that are answered and yet we're supposed to accept that everything is finished in the families eyes yet clearly its not from the ending.   Even the movie seems self-aware that the mystery is still yet to be solved (Alice remaining in the house) and yet the family move on as if it is. If anything this movie just gives the horrible message that if you die under extremely mysterious circumstances no one, not even your own family, will care enough to try and figure it out before running away from where it all happened. The real horror, for me, is the idea that as individuals we may never be truly known by others while we're alive, even if we're well-liked. After our deaths, people may realize they never truly knew us, but the living are so caught up with moving forward in life that they can't be bothered to care. 

I think a lot of the movie is about being alone and unknown in life and in death.",Just rewatched Lake Mungo and found the general theme of being ignored/not known more depressing than scary.

horror,sub,[removed],MY STEPFATHER.
horror,sub,"A bit of preamble to set the mood; I was raised in a very rural, isolated section of America.  Right on the Michigan, Wisconsin border, where it's mostly forests and dilapidated old farms, and miles and miles of the longest, most secluded old highways in the northern half of the country.  

I've always contended that the area itself is often so spooky that the location alone is perfect for the horror genre.  It's the kind of iconic environment - like the salt mines in Day of The Dead, or the caves in the Descent - that is so unnerving in its own right that it can be unsettling even when nothing overtly threatening is happening. 

I have to travel a lot of distance in this area on a regular basis. As I've driven by myself on these trips my thoughts have turned to those things that truly scare me. As a result I  have been toying for a few years now with a concept for a horror film set in the area combining the environment with, in my opinion, one of the scariest things a person can experience in every day life.  Encountering another person on these lonely back roads. The problem is I don't fully know how to translate that concept to a full fledged story. 

I don't have anything concrete.  I have a few visuals in my head, a hand full of scenes, an idea for the protagonist.  Primarily, however, it all centers around the one visual I've always been most afraid of. Headlights at night.  

In my opinion there is nothing scarier in the world than headlights on a dark night. When you're traveling down a broken old highway through ghost towns and cow pastures and thick forests at 2 in the morning for God knows what reason and suddenly, after hours of emptiness, two little specs of light come winding out of the darkness behind you… that's an immediate and palpable tension I suspect a lot of people can relate to.  

I'm looking for someone who might be interested in working with me as a writing partner, and helping to flesh out this really basic concept. I admittedly am not the best at really forming whole stories as a writer, and I often have difficulty beginning and completing things because of that. I'm good at concepts,  individual scenes, I can write pretty good dialogue from time to time as well. What I really need is someone good with structure, beginning, middle, and end that would be willing to have a back and forth communication to give more life to this kernel of an idea and then help to translate that into a full fledged script.  

I'm open to any kind of collaboration ideas anybody might have. So if this sounds appealing at all to anyone, hit me up. The worst that can happen is that nothing gets written.",Looking for a writing partner for basic concept

So does anyone know the record for most on screen kills in a slasher or an estimate? I have looked and can’t find it. I have found total kill numbers but they are scewed af. I don’t mean a war happening on screen then it being announced 1000 people died or like the girl in the rings crazy body count that weren’t really on screen kills but every list counts them as or the earth being wiped out by something, I mean the most fully on screen that slasher in front of your eyes no cuts to black kills a person on screen kills in a movie. As of right now it’s varying/increasing but we are looking to have 20-24 on screen kills. 

We are also in the works of creating a YouTube channel for it along with a Patreon (not asking to raise money) just gonna have tiers for extra stuff bonus scenes etc if people are interested early access etc.",Slasher movie with the most on screen kills? Record (making a fan film)

horror,sub,"We’ve all seen one of these horror flicks. The ones who premise was intriguing but they either ended up poorly executed, badly acted, poorly written, or devolved into the same old same old tricks and cliches of the genres. 

Obviously this is subjective and entirely a matter of opinion but I’m interested to hear what movies you thought held such promise only to be disappointed by? 

My top two are Ghost Ship and Sam Was Here. 

Ghost Ship has, hands down, the most gorgeous (horror wise) beginning ever committed to film. 
But after that it just falls flat with cheap jump scares, a trite plot, and an utter waste of an idea. 

If you have a grim reaper who can only take souls at sea THAT should be your main plot, not some heist/salvage/ghost revenge premise. Such a waste. 

Sam Was Here was somewhat intriguing and the idea was unique enough that I desperately wish they had gone further with it. A guy can’t leave a desert town, all locals are hostile, and the radio station is running a smear campaign against him. 

The problem is that they spent so much time on atmosphere that the actual story was super muddled. Had more care been given to dialogue, radio broadcasts, etc the ending would have had far more impact and actually tickled at making sense as opposed to what it was. Instead audiences are left with a great big “huh?” at the end, no clear connection between “bad guy” and plot, let alone climax/ending and plot, and it leaves you feeling like the film was more concerned with trying to be clever than actual story telling. And I’m not even one of those who needs everything tied up neatly and clearly explained, but some threads of connection are required!

So what about you guys?",What are movies that had the POTENTIAL to be so damn good but the execution just made them “meh”?

horror,sub,"I always see people say “James Wan makes jump scares work” when discussing his films. Jump scares get a bad rep but for some reason it seems like Wan gets a pass. What’s the difference when he does it? Granted, I only have The Conjuring to go off of. But in that movie he uses at least one false scare that I can think of, uses artificial loud noise, and does the stereotypical ‘look one way see nothing, turn back around and boom somethings in your face’ scare. These are all things that typically annoy horror fans. So why does Wan get a pass? Full disclosure, I like The Conjuring and am not a fan of jump scares either so I can’t even explain it myself. If I had to guess why I like it enough to offset my disdain for jump scares, I’d say I’m a fan of the time period, Loretta and Ed are compelling characters and the acting is done well all around, and there’s a slow buildup of jump scares and dread. At the beginning of the movie, there’s moments where things go quiet and you expect a jump and nothing happens. Other times something jumps when you least expect it, like the picture frames falling off the wall. So it keeps me on my toes. What do y’all think?",Can somebody explain to me what the difference is between a James Wan jump scare and everyone else’s?

horror,sub,"now dont get me wrong blair witch isnt a masterpiece its fine but i hated the blair witch project

you know the number one thing i though through out watching the blair witch project was ""SHUT UP HEATHER"" and i get that the blair witch project's legacy is important in horror but it just didnt do anything for me.

blair witch on the other hand added something fresh to the story

now i am a person who doesnt like when unnecessary back story is added to films (ex rob zombie's halloween and rings) but i liked this.

i mean sure a lot of the characters were annoying but they went into the blair witch house, we saw part of a creature, the scene where the girl is crawling through that tunnel was so claustrophobic, breaking the stick figure and the girl snapped in half.

i figured in blair witch project the blair witch controlled the woods and thats why they couldnt find their way out. (apparently not every thought that) and blair witch confirmed it.

and i know this is a super unpopular opinion but i actually like when we get to see the monster.

Not many people know about this, but the filmmakers tried crowd funding a sequel a few years back (multiple times actually). The last time it was to produce a comic book series, in hopes of selling enough to fund the movie. I assume they never made their goal because I haven’t heard any news from them in years

If anyone is interested, you can buy the comic book series [on their website ](https://www.vernonsfarmhouse.com/shop)

It is an official prequel/sequel but I’m a huge fan of the original and I was kind of disappointed by this. It feels kind of rushed and not well edited. 

I really hoped they could get the movie done at some point but I just don’t see it happening. I would still recommend anyone who is a fan of the original to check this out because it does still scratch that itch.

horror,sub,"In popular culture, there was a long fascination with the 80s beginning around 2003 and continuing until we got so sick of Reaganism that we started burning the country down to get rid of that manure. So I've seen the 80s through many lenses, I remember how the 80s were mocked in the 90s, something I've never seen regarding any other decade, ie I can't recall people in 2011 talking smack about the 2000s.  Partly that was driven by a sweeping change in pop culture, where much of the 80s was kindling for the fires that later burned -- and burn again, really.   


People lived through this time of conformity, ""I didn't sell out, I bought in"" was a real concept in an era where 401ks were new. Ronald Reagan held a national celebration of Ice Cream, Nancy Reagan gave children a laundry list of drugs to try, and they literally made fun of AIDS in White House Press Conferences. The press laughed along with the politicians. And People who didn't agree with this bullshit, some of them made movies.   


I'm unsure why Slashers are the genre everyone thinks of when considering the 80s. Definitely there are some great slasher movies in the era, yet the genre was clearly made whole in the 70s with Halloween (1978). Friday the 13th was released in 1980, was filmed in the summer of 1979. And of course Psycho, a film of the 60s, is just too ahead of its time to be properly situated in a convenient chronology.   


Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street would on their own make the 80s relevant, but they are some of the best horror films of the 80s. Part of the spirit of the 80s was to laugh along with the villain, in some voyeuristic journey to taste darkness.  Horror comedy was revitalized.   


* The Re-Animator
* Return of the Living Dead
* American Werewolf in London
* Beetlejuice, Gremlins, The Lost Boys, Fright Night, Ghost Busters, it's a long list
* House
* Evil Dead II
* Killer Klowns from Outer Space

Ghost Busters itself is filled with Reaganisms -- small business entrepreneurs save the city where the government failed or actively made the situation worse.  The government doesn't need to make propaganda, artists do it on their own, when the authority's tastes are in line with the artist's vision.   


But not everyone bought into ""business will save us all."" And these films are to this day some of the most aggressive and incendiary horror films ever made.  These films are angry, they don't respect the tenor of society. The films reflect the work of people ready to tear society down.

* They Live
* Day of the Dead
* Halloween III
* Children of the Corn
* Toxic Avenger
* Blue Velvet
* Society

Some thought sexual exploration and personal introspection would save us. Keep in mind in the 80s, to be damned was to be in the cool crowd, because the squares were all about telling you how playing D&amp;D would send you to hell. And Slayer, Blackie Lawlesss music, etc. This was the era when Tipper Gore wanted to create a federal agency to regulate music -- and inevitably, movies. So, to be amongst the damned, was to reject that censorship bullshit, smoke a doob and blast your satanic metal. Listening to Slayer was an act of defiance, and in that spirit, there are these films. Reasons for being damned: sex, thinking, exploring.

* Hellraiser
* Cat People (1982 remake)
* The Hunger 

Horror was wonderfully mainstream in the 80s, unparalleled to this day. 

* Poltergeist
* Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 
* Goonies
* Something Wicked This Way Comes is a Disney movie!
* Little Shop of Horrors

The rise of VCRs created an entirely new model for making movies for profit. This was the first time you did not have to go to a theater to see a movie. OVAs became a thing -- original video animation -- and introduced a global audience to Japanese horror and art. 

* Vampire Hunter D (1985)
* Digital Devil Saga: Megami Tensei
* Tetsuo: The Iron Man (not animated, but part of the this burgeoning Japanese direct to video format, before the US was swamped with their own)

In the 1980s major studios made horror films for children, and didn't just relegate the genre of children's horror to nickelodeon.

* The Gate
* The Dark Crystal
* The Care Bears Movie (1985)
* Return to Oz (another Disney film, at one point Dorthy is in a mental institution, about to receive electoshock therapy. That's way scarier than the fun but not nightmare inducing RL Stine movie.)
* The Monster Squad

In the 80s, horror was mainstream to a degree that has only been matched very recently. The bluntest measurement is the sheer volume of movies made; far more horror movies were made in the 80s VS the 70s, and far more horror films were made in the 70s versus the 90s.

*spoilers maybe*

It was really disappointing in my opinion. Most of the movie just builds up to a disappointing 3rd act that's really generic with the ""house/apartment is deteriorating like a character's mind"". The build up wasn't even that engaging or built up any tension either. While i do like the metaphor it doesn't do anything new with it. I also found the cinematography and look of the movie very bland. It's mostly dark in an old house like many other horror films.

horror,sub,"One hell of a wordy title, right? Well, I couldn't think of a better way to put it. Both these movies distinguish themselves by being based around Indian women/girls, victimised by real-world social problems in modern and historical Indian culture, taking supernatural revenge. Both are also available on Netflix.

Disclaimer: I am a white Western (transgender) man, though I watched both these films with my Indian woman best friend and listened to her opinions, if that gives me any more perspective.

Warning: spoilers ahead, big and specific ones tagged but small ones not so much.

*Bulbbul* was my more recent watch, saw it last night. I think it's a recent release also. It's Bollywood, and it's set in a historical setting, in 1881. The story is that of an abused child bride, the eponymous Bulbbul, married off to an older man at five years old, becoming &gt;! a man-killing witch goddess who murders abusive men and is distinguished by her backwards feet.&lt; The movie is framed non-linearly, with a ""now"" story-line of her childhood love, Satya, the younger brother of her arranged husband, trying to solve the murders that locals claim were done by the ""Demon Woman"", and interwoven flashbacks showing the abuses and events that brought Bulbbul to this point.

Frankly, I didn't like the way this movie handled its very interesting premise. The idea was full of promise, and I was very excited to see this movie. However, I didn't like how it ended up playing out. 

I saw another review call it ""over-directed and under-written"", and this seems to sum up a large part of my thoughts on why it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was a very *beautiful* movie, with its red mist and black shadows based Gothic-inspired night shots of the murders, and the rich Indian costuming in the day scenes, along with clever angles and editing. It suffered in places from bizarrely unnecessary poorly CGI-ed backdrops, which seem almost ubiquitous in South Asian horror, but otherwise, was definitely a feast for the eyes, and I think the shot directing and costume departments both should be commended.

However, the mystery was simplistic, to the point where it was almost unbelievable that it took certain characters in the movie so long to figure out the ""twist"" that we, as the audience, had guessed at least an hour before.

More damningly, I didn't like how the movie handled its real-life social issue plot. Child brides, abuse of women, and sexual assault are very real issues in Indian society, and not just, of course, in India, but world-wide. However, the way *Bulbbul* used these issues seemed more gratuitous than respectful. There is a place for implication when it comes to the brutalization of women, or anyone else, on-screen. For example, I did not need to see &gt;!Bulbbul's rapist brother-in-law have sex to the point of orgasm with her semi-conscious, bed-ridden from her husband's abuse, body&lt; in order to know that &gt;!she was raped&lt;. Grindhouse horror and exploitation films are, of course, a genre of their own, but this was not what this film was billed it, and, overall, I found that it used gratuitous scenes of brutality to substitute for actual scares, as the rest of the plot, especially the supernatural elements, were more gory fairy-tale than actual horror.

*Kanika* I watched a while ago. It is a Marathi film, rather than Bollywood, which pulls heavily from films like The Ring, with its creepy little girl ghost. *Kanika* tells the story of &gt;!a ghost of a small girl who was killed by her father due to his desire for a son, being helped to exact revenge on everyone possibly involved by her vengeful, imprisoned mother&lt;. Once again, &gt;!female infanticide&lt; is a very pertinent social issue in many cultures. Unlike *Bulbbul*, *Kanika* does not make use of a period setting, as it is set in modern day.

The scares in *Kanika* are familiar, but nonetheless provide a pleasing shot of adrenaline. It shares its gory practical effects, green filter, and bleak, bleached-out hospital scenes with many other films in the genre, and uses them decently well. Once again, the narrative incorporates flashbacks that slowly reveal to the main characters who the ghost girl is and why she is killing, but these are more straight-forward flashbacks, not the non-linear, dreamlike narrative of *Bulbbul*.

The mystery of *Kanika* felt much more satisfying than that in *Bulbbul*. With *Kanika* it took me, as the audience, almost as long as it took the main characters to figure out exactly what this movie was about. I knew it was about ""a social issue"", but I did not know, going in, which one, and I was intrigued to find out. Furthermore, I found the choice to make the ""protagonists"" &gt;!doctors implicated in various ways in the events that led Kanika's father and grandmother to murder her&lt;, and thus, in a way, guilty themselves very interesting, as it complicated the unraveling of the mystery as they were forced to confront their own complicity in a toxic social structure that allows these kind of atrocities.

The movie itself was a simple guilty-pleasure ghost movie with an intriguing and heartbreaking mystery at its heart, but I certainly found its handling of the real-world issues at its core much more sensitive than Bulbbul. We &gt;!witness the young Kanika's murder at her father's hands&lt; and later also &gt;!the poisoning of her father and grandfather by her vengeful mother&lt;, but these scenes do not come off as excessive or gratuitous, they are rather more sensitively shown. I also liked the plot making it clear that &gt;!Kanika's grandmother encouraged her father to murder her&lt;, as it let in the morally-grey shades of a society in which women contribute to perpetuating misogynist ideals and actions. Overall, I left *Kanika* feeling sick to my stomach because of the implications, not the visuals, and I found the revenge that Kanika &gt;!and her mother&lt; exacted satisfying, even if the characters killed were not always directly implicated in the crime. I felt sympathy for those behind these murders, and understood their anger.

Overall, both *Kanika* and *Bulbbul* are worth a watch, but if you want typical horror and a good mystery, go for *Kanika*. If you want a simple but (at points sickeningly) gory fairy-tale, with gorgeous period costumes, go for *Bulbbul*.",Indian social issue revenge horror: Kanika and Bulbbul

As a horror academic I am all too aware at how pretentious we can seem when we write about the genre so to see the loving ribbing they gave us was wonderful (I’m mostly talking about all the discussions they have on phallic and yonic imagery here. It’s some great parodies of Clover, Creed, and others). 

The coolest part though (only for me) is that my mom’s company (well firmer company , she now works for their sister company) got product placement in the film!

horror,sub,"So I know I'm 10 years late to this party but here goes.  I've read a lot about this film both here and elsewhere and I realize that it's incredibly polarizing.

General consensus seems to be that people either love it or hate it.  Most seem to fall in the hate category.  I watched it  earlier today and since then I can't get it out of my head.  I think I liked it.  I may even love it but I'm still processing what I saw and probably need to do a rewatch.

I've always been a sucker for A) slow burn horror movies where things begin off kilter and then gradually spiral into straight-up insanity and B) films about being lost in the woods.  This movie pushes both buttons.

From what I've read,a major point of consternation about this movie is its ending which offers no clear answers about what the hell happened and is, frankly,  wide open to  multiple interpretations.

However when you stop and think about the fact that its characters are investigating the unsolved disappearance of an entire town's population a vague ending probably makes perfect sense.

horror,sub,"I was thinking the other day, the only type of horror that actually scares me is supernatural - anything with ghosts, demons, possession - that's what does it for me. I'm not particularly religious either, so I'm not sure where that fear comes from.

Not all of them though, they still have to be well written, well acted, have a decent story and (to an extent) special effects - I don't want to be pulled out of it by shoddy, muppet looking demons.

If I was to give an example of a film that scared me recently, and for this I'd have to go back quite a few years, I'd say the **beginning** of Insidious - up until they show the demon in his little workshop sharpening tools - that totally killed it for me - not scared at all after that. And perhaps a couple of The Conjuring films - there really aren't that many. 

Oh and parts of Hereditary (but not all of it, some of it was a bit laughable in places). Their teenage boy massively overacts in the scene where they stand holding hands around the table - it broke all the illusion for me. I was more freaked by the subtle shadowy figure of her mum appearing in front of her in the darkened room (near the start, after her funeral) - that shit me up real nice.

As for other examples, I'd have to go back even further and say, the first Poltergeist, The Exorcist, The Entity, The Blair Witch Project (only the end part), probably more I can't remember.

As for other sub-genres, I can watch slashers, zombie flicks, sci-fi aliens type films, serial killers, abstract stuff, pretty much all of it I enjoy, rather than feeling any genuine fear. Sure, I might feel tense for the characters in danger, but fear is definitely not on my mind.

The only type of horror that actually scares me is supernatural.

**Autopsy aka Macchie Solari (1975)** A pathologist (Mimsy Farmer) has visions of dead bodies in the morgue getting up and coming after her. She and a racecar driving priest determine that a recent rash of suicides in Rome are actually murders. Some ultra violence in this one, including a gunshot victim who’s eyeball is popped out. Another interesting scene takes place in a true crime museum, with load of unpleasant photos. Some of the humorous dialog includes Mimsy’s boyfriend telling her “You can’t blame a guy for trying” after she fends off a violent rape attempt. In fact, from start to finish she’s just about the most disrespected doctor I’ve ever seen in a movie! Also a lot of nudity in this enjoyable giallo, including from the lead actress.

**Screamers aka Island of Fishmen (1979)** One of the best giallo directors, Sergio Martino, brings us this tale of a shipwreck of a prison ship on a mysterious Island, inhabited by a rich guy and his servants, and Barbara (Mrs Ringo Starr) Bach. Oh, and a bunch of fish-face creature from the black lagoons!  And an old Joseph Cotton, who had made the transition from Hollywood A-List to Italian exploitation by this time in his career. Not bad at all, and pretty violent, though no nudity from Mrs. Ringo. The US version (Screamers) has an extra 12 minute intro (w/ Cameron Mitchell) that didn’t help the story much, but was obviously there to spruce up the gore content. This was like Doctor Butcher MD meets Humanoids from the Deep with Island of Dr. Moreau and a sprinkle of Son of Kong!  Though not as good as those, but still good.

**Beyond the Door (1974)** Italian combo rip-off of both The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby. A demon possesses the body of a pregnant mother of two and she have has crazy sex dreams and swears and spits up pea soup during her waking hours.  Her younger son ate Campbell’s Peas Soup all the time, and they even had a Warhol homage on the wall! It drags at nearly 2 hours, but the end was OK. The same year she was wearing green teeth in Italy for this one, lead actress Juliet Mills was winning an Emmy for an American mini-series.  Originally called Who Are You in Italian, and sometimes known as The Devil Within Her in the States. 

**Shock (1977)** Mario Bava’s last film, Lamberto Bava got assistant director and screenwriting credit. Daria Nicoledi moves back into her former house with her new husband and her 10 year old boy. She’s a former junkie who apparently drove her late husband to suicide. Some force in the house controls the kid to cause his mom to suffer a few minor household accidents, and she is having crazy violent/erotic dreams. Slow paced at first, but the last 20 minutes were quite exciting. Originally released in the US as Beyond the Door 2, even though the films are unrelated.

**All the Colors of Giallo (2019)** Pretty OK documentary with lots of clips and interviews, featuring mostly the films of Diario Argento, Mario Bava, Sergio Martino, Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzzi, and a few one-offs. They left out a few that I thought were important. Things I learned though a recorded interview with Fulci was that he and Dario didn’t like eachother. 

**Deathsport (1978)** Post-apocalyptic borefest from Roger Corman’s New World Pictures has David Carradine and Claudia Jennings captured by Richard Lynch to participate in government sanctioned death games with motorcycle gladiators. Also with lots of disintegration lasers and mutants. Sounds great, yeah, but it wasn’t. If not for a good amount of nudity, most of it from Claudia, who was 1970’s Playmate of the Year, I’m not sure I would have made it. Director Alan Arkush’s next movie would be the much more fun Rock n Roll High School. 

**The Beach House (2019)** A college couple and a middle-aged couple share a beach house, and after 50 minutes of incredibly dull character development, a fog rolls in and some body-horror stuff starts to happen. I know a lot of people like the “slow burn” these days but it took me right out of the game, by the time anything happened I already didn’t care anymore.

The gore is pretty sweet and the characters (at least 2 of them) were strong and very likable enough to root for.  I even liked the ending which is honestly what I feared would ruin the film (totally didnt).

I mean this is no redefining genre film but I totally put it with other ""different style"" of slasher/camping movies lileke SHROOMS and whatnot.

Have you seen it? Will you give it a chance?",Have you seen Summer Camp? A fun mix between Evil Dead and Cabin Fever.

I really didn't care much what happened to Steven and his family...I was just anxious for the film to be over - and it plays out in a fairly predictable fashion.

horror,sub,"It was obviously very selfish and wrong of him to even marry Grace knowing there was a possibility that she would have to die. BUT while rewatching it I actually felt a little sad for him. He grew up in an extremely dysfunctional family where he was traumatized at a young age and had to partake in rituals regularly. He did not agree with that lifestyle so distanced himself from it and eventually met Grace who made him feel like maybe it was possible for him to be normal. Out of fear that he'd lose her he (wrongly) asked Grace to marry him. She got the bad card, he initially did everything he could to help her. Then at the end of the movie, his brother Daniel dies and he walks in on her mother brutally killed too, the only 2 members of his family he loved. He might have said that he would rather them die than her but seeing it is different. He realizes she'll never want to stay with him after this and gives up, willing to sacrifice her.

horror,sub,"I had beaten A Hat in Time a while back and I remembered getting surprisingly apprehensive during a level late in the game called Queen Vanessa's Manor. I saw a video that highlighted it, and I can now say why that was.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfdDmr553mk&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfdDmr553mk&amp;) 

First off, there's the color scheme. It's not just dark, it's got a red/blue/purple palette that highlights the gloominess of the mansion. Next, there's the lack of other enemies compared to the other levels- it showcases just how lonely and creepy the manor is with its single occupant. Then you have the sound design- Vanessa sounds like a monstrosity that will destroy you if you let her. And combine that with her cyclopean look and you have a terrifying level!

horror,sub,"I watched this maybe a month ago on either Prime, Hulu or Netflix. I know that doesn’t narrow it down much. 

Sorry if this is a poor description. The movie was pretty confusing and more of a psychological thriller/horror. 

The story line was a husband and wife had recently loss their child in a traumatic way. The father’s grief was far more intense and longer lasting than the mother. The father started thinking he was going insane because he started to see his dead daughter in his house as if she never died. The mother was worried about him and he was having psychotic fits and night terrors. 

Eventually he starts looking into quantum psychics and multidimensional theories, and tries to figure out a way create a new reality for him in his wife where their daughter never died. He ends up being successful in bringing his daughter back but from my understanding, whatever reality he put them in was one in which the mother carried the grief of their daughter, even though she was alive. It was kind of like postpartum depression, except her daughter was maybe 10 years old. Then all this physics stuff started kicking in and the worlds start shaking like crazy and all the characters end up being like particles instead of people on and off for a few minutes. They’re in their backyard and they’re all freaking out hugging while they scream together. My guess is they were entering and exiting dimensions beyond the 3D back and forth for a few minutes.

TBWP: My number one horror movie is the Blair Witch Project. Most horror movies don’t scare me, but this one freaks me out just thinking of it. I have never been able to watch it again because it freaks me the fuck out. It captures that 90’s vibe and is so close to something that could actually happen. The movie never shows the witch and you expect to see it at some point and the panic builds. Then that last scene with the dude facing the corner..... The whole concept of the bwp was built on a folklore and stayed realistic the entire time and reveals just enough to leave your imagination spinning. Idk just the woods, camping, it was such a basic story but it built that sense of panic and realness to pull you into the fact that this shit happened (even tho it didn’t). 

The Conjuring: I loved everything about this movie, but I wish it didn’t have a happy ending and I wish they left you guessing more. 

Don’t like found footage except Blair witch and Creep. Not a fan of environmental horror either.",Need recommendations for movies that dont reveal the monster/demon

Whenever I look for new horror films to watch I feel like the case is either I’ve already seen it, or it just doesn’t seem interesting or scary to me. I wasn’t a fan of movies like Ouija, The Conjuring, Insidious, etc.

horror,sub,"For some backstory, Lucifer Valentine is the director of the infamous Vomit Gore Trilogy (there are five films now) that depict really graphic scenes of women being mutilated and legit vomiting. Think a pretentious horror movie version of Lars Von Trier that’s very fetish pornographic-like.

I first discovered Lucifer Valentine years ago right when I turned 14 (I will be 20 next week). Despite his movies being borderline pornographic, we became very close and he would always contact me asking if I’d want artwork from him or if I’d want to star in one of his movies when I turned 18. While I was in various VGT related FB groups, I spoke with girls who told me very disturbing stories about how he groomed them. They told me how he scouts female fans right after they turn 18 and manipulate them into starring into his movies. Most of the women who are fans of him have eating disorders and throughout his films, he depicts his fetish for women having bulimia. Pretty fucked up.

As I’ve gotten older, I’ve left that part of my life behind me. However, there have been some pretty disturbing allegations against LV on Twitter in the past few months. [This](https://twitter.com/m_nessk/status/1270423934396055552?s=21) twitter thread brings into question the safety of the actresses involved in those films. As someone who watched all the behind the scenes features, all the actresses looked very drugged out and incoherent when talking to LV in the middle of shooting. People are speculating that they might have been drugged or abused on set and I believe it.

Even more disturbing, The Soska Sisters (American Mary/See No Evil 2) starred in one of his movies way back in 2008 and had an incestious sex scene. They completely deny that they were in the movie despite them being credited. I had a friend who reviewed American Mary years ago and when he mentioned that they starred in one of his films, they begged him to remove it out of his review. I also heard that they were stalked by a LV “hater” at a horror convention, asking them for his personal information which brought them to tears.

I hope that more information comes out about him and that we find out the real truth. It must mean something if all the actresses that starred in his film have gone without a trace (no social media pages or anything) and that the Soska Sisters, who are very famous in the horror community, have disavowed their involvement in his films.

It also talks about some of what is happening with Clive Barker's plan to grab back Hellraiser. 

To me, the article looks like bad news. It looks like Victor Miller will win ultimately, but he will only get the rights to the original Friday the 13th and those elements which originates there. Everything that originates after that will belong to Cunningham. So Miller would get Camp Crystal Lake, Pamela Voorhees, and Kid Jason. Which might mean that adult Jason would be in limbo since the character originated with Miller but the image as we think of him came from later movies. So maybe Cunningham could make a movie about a hockey mask wearing killer who is never referred to as Jason and doesn't stalk near Crystal Lake (or maybe any lake or any camp).  Which would probably suck. 

As the article points out, there's probably already a lot of money left on the table (Halloween 2018 made $255 million alone, all 12 Friday the 13th movies made about $475 million). If they are dumb enough to not settle the matter now, I do not know why they would be after the appeals court decides. So we may have to ""look forward to"" some other kind of Friday the 13th where a headless Pamela Voorhees stalks counselors and another one where a fake Jason stalks people on, I dunno, like a river rafting trip?","Friday the 13th: Rundown of the current standing of the F13 legal battle, with related issues with Hellraiser and NOES"

horror,sub,"We have seen the delay of higher budget horror, like Halloween Kills, Jigsaw, Quiet Place 2, etc. These are movies studios expect massive returns from, they don't want to release them if they don't have high confidence that:

1. Most theaters internationally will be open
2. Most of the demographic for that movie will be comfortable with going to a theater
3. Theater capacity is high enough to support any social distancing protocols applicable in each region: say a theater limits itself to 50% capacity, a movie like It which I had to wait in a long line for will now have a line twice the length, and perhaps requiring a virtual queue. This also puts an upper limit on movie revenue: many people, if they can't see a movie on Friday night, won't want to go see it Saturday at noon. This could put off many people (see #2).

The odds of #1-3 happening seems rather low. Even if 100 countries have the virus under control, if 10 don't, that is reduced revenue for the studio. I think the key part is international here. 

I think once we have a vaccine/etc, #1-3 will occur within a couple months, but since these movies' release schedules are planned out way in advance, there is a delay there too.

It seems likely to me that no big budget movies of any genre will be released in 2020.

However if some theaters are open, studios are basically wasting a potential revenue stream if they don't release anything.

My thinking is studios will use this time to offload movies that had a low enough budget, and have low enough profit expectations, that studios don't mind releasing them in non-ideal conditions. Such as January: in the US, most people are getting busy at work, in many regions it is snowing or ice cold, etc. Or in the present situation.

Perhaps there will be movies that were scheduled to be VOD/streaming  that will now make it into theaters.","Will the non-ideal theater situation lead to more low-budget ""January"" or even VOD/streaming horror going into theaters?"

""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" was made at Cannon Films for a low budget, and Wes Craven was initially offered the job.  I guess he was pretty much going to do it but had creative differences with Christopher Reeve; one article said they just didn't get along.  You have to wonder what his ideas were for the film or what drew him to it.  Probably would have been pretty good.  He had already done a DC film with ""Swamp Thing"".  

Even more odd, Cannon was also going to make a Spider-Man movie in the '80s.  Apparently the studio chiefs had no idea what the character was about and commissioned a body horror script where Peter is turned into a spider hybrid/mutant.  It doesn't even sound like crime fighting was involved.  It turns out Tobe Hooper was likely going to direct it.

horror,sub,[removed],Best Scary Movie? And Why?
horror,sub,"So I just watched Jeff Brown's 2019 Shudder original film, 'The Beach house', and I have some thoughts on some of its themes, subtexts, and even a few hidden plot messages I think could have some baring. 

First of all, I enjoyed this movie, its bombastic spirit of Lovecraft, 50's sci-fi, and even some fun nods to the likes of Alien &amp; John Carpenter's 'The Fog'. 
I also enjoyed the knowledge that this film is apparently very much based on an actual beach vacation turned break up the writer/director went through in his real life. That made things more fun.

Despite some expletive laden reviews I read on Shudder, I thought the acting was well done, and very supportive to the story these characters were trying to tell, even among those who had very few lines of actually dialogue to do so. The tension between the respective couples, and their struggles rang true without much background into their lives prior to the events taking place. The awkwardness, sadness, and stress all felt very human to me.  

Now, before I get too caught up in review land, here's what I am thinking is beneath the surface of this film (no pun intended) and maybe some of you fine horror fiends can talk me down off my ledge with this (or hopefully agree and call me a genius).
I think it is as much a tale of millennial anxiety, and the feeling of being on the forefronts of a losing battle to save a dying world, with absolutely no hope of doing so-- as it is a fun, summer. creature feature with an underlying sub plot of an uncomfortable, tail spinning relationship between two confused twenty-somethings condemned to 
die in a deserted, off-season beach town.

My reasoning for inking such broad strokes into thematic catastrophe is that to me, each character is a representative for a different piece of the puzzle in modern society, and the invasive creatures overtaking them could be a blanketed representation of all of its problems as they seem to continue to pile up and compound into further complexity.   

Take Emily, for example; our female lead. To me, she is the portrait of all that is good and hopeful in the youth of today, in regards to carrying on the torch of the next generation to some meaningful, maybe even habitable place to exist in. She is bright, caring, curious, thoughtful, enduring, educated, kind and brave. In fact, in so far as the film allows us into her personal life, her only flaw seems to in her association with her boyfriend, Randell. 

To me, Randell is representative of the portion of the millennial generation (or really, any generation) that has become brutally pessimistic, resigned, conscienceless, or without a hope for a tomorrow. He is privileged, capable (but lazy), fearful, dismissive, (especially of Emily, or her dreams) and cowardly. This is clearly shown when he insists very hastily that Emily drop out of grad school and simply hide away in his fathers beach house with him for a few years. Very forward thinking, Randell.

Now to me, the older couple, Mitch and Jane Turner, seem to basically represent the older generations, particularly the ""boomers"", and the various issues they collectively face today (including those issues within the generation divide between them and their younger counterparts), particularly, their resignation to watch the world burn without a care one way or the other, if for no other reason that they simply won't be in it much longer. (Dramatic, yes. But this horror we are talking about here. Irrational paranoia are like chum in the waters for our fear). They (The Turners) are displayed as being so far behind on the problems of the times, and so out of touch with anything outside of their own bubble of reality, that they simply nod along and smile, trying desperately to ""just keep their heads down paying attention to their baseball"", as Mitch puts cheekily mentions in a conversation with Emily. 
This notion is supported several times throughout the film; first when Emily is explaining the inner workings of her science studies to Jane, who follows along only half coherently (after ingesting some primo pot brownies--no doubt a ham handed delivery system to simultaneously add to Randell's character development as cynical, non-empatheic and irresponsible, as well to as add credibility to the sequence of hallucinatory effects taking hold at the tendrils of the mysterious sea creatures swilling around inside of their bodies/in the very air they are breathing). 
The lack of awareness is also seen when Mitch later gives his unsettling confession to Emily, of simply trying to have ""one last trip"" with his wife before she passes of what is only vaguely suggested as a terminal disease, just before he walks off into the ocean, never to be seen again. If I were trying to find a better metaphor for the complexity of the issues faced between the cross generational gap in America today, I would be hard pressed to find one that works as well as this one does.

It all comes to a head when Emily ditches a white eyed, doomed Randell (thank God) drives off aimlessly through a fog (or giant, Lovecraftian spore cloud?) thick enough to cut with a butcher knife, and crashes into a tree-- all of which eventually leads somehow turning up on a beach the next morning, where she has clearly been ravaged by the tiny, invasive sea creatures, just as presumably every other character we have met has been. We know this because she is pale, lifeless, clammy, and afflicted with eyes that are a a creepy, unsettling blue that gave me nightmares.  Her last words before being washed away off screen are ""Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Don't be scared.""

This is the state of things. This is the new normal. This is the daily reminder we tell ourselves as we step into each new day filled with anxiety, fear and a low level dread in the knowledge that whatever horrible, new information that is coming around the bend next is OUR problem to deal with, and that we may have absolutely no idea how to identify what it is at its core, or how to face it.
It's like we are being invaded, and have a capacity to deal with it more closely akin to the clunky, dial up tone computers of our childhoods than that of the high speed demands that feel expected of us increasingly with each passing day. *BOOOO.... WEEEE OOH EEEH OOOH BOOP*. 
We feel like we are being pushed out to sea without a paddle, a flotation device, or even a convenient air breach in our space ship for which to cast the phallic, acid spewing creature out into deep space with (see; Ripley). 
When just yesterday, our problems were Grad programs, unexpected guests, and shitty, control freak boyfriends --Today they are Vague, mysterious enemies that attack us by air, by water --they are already inside of us. Ancient, new, vaguely biological, and unidentifiable, even to the student.

Not only indicative of this next random catastrophe that we all seem to be waiting for, but the creatures are also the collective snowballing in a laundry list of mounting social and environmental issues that demand immediate action but have no definite solution: Climate change, political discourse, in fighting, racial tensions/injustices, the looming threat of nuclear war and a coming extinction, and interestingly enough, an actual pandemic. (This film was first screened in 2019 during the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival, just before the outbreak of COVID had taken hold. And it's almost chilling how well this still fits here on our list.) 

We feel overwhelmed, constantly stressed/anxious, and powerless. 

For those of us who aren't the 'Randells' of our world (we all know at least one, and probably more), there is a sense of dread, unease and often times, a rationally sound hopelessness going into each day as we say to ourselves ""...Don't be scared.""","Can we talk about ""The Beach house""? *SPOILERS*"

Hello everyone,

I'm making a story for a horror game which I'll eventually make.

This is just a demo intro to the story and I would love to hear your opinion and suggestions for it.

"" The year is 1993 and a few teenagers decided to check out a haunted house down the street. The house was more like a mansion, and they heard a lot of stories about the horrors that happen in it. 20 years ago, one 17-year old kid, named Vincent, went to the mansion, and was never seen again. Some say the Mansion is alive, some say that there are beasts inside.

Once they arrived at the front gate, they mocked Mark how he can’t enter it. After a few minutes, he went through the gate, as other followed. After couple of steps they all felt a cold breeze and felt shivers throughout their whole bodies. As Mark turned around to check on the others, he realized that he’s all alone.

When he came back to his senses, he felt something calling him to the slightly-opened front door of the Mansion.

When he got to the porch, the door opened and he heard a deep male voice coming from the house that said “Welcome!”

Right after he went through, the door slammed shut in front of him and couldn’t be opened again.

Mark realized that the only thing he could do was to look for his friends, and try to get out of here.

He entered a big room with wooden staircase in the middle that went upwards and separated in different directions. Below each staircase were rooms. There was a muffled noise coming from the right room. Suddenly that door opened and a huge skinny pale humanoid figure was standing at the doorway covered in bloody and ripped cloth. The face of the humanoid seemed ripped apart in half. There were muscles and skin hanging. He left a bloody trail from the fresh wound and it was so deep, that you could see his cheekbone.

When Nicole (3rd floor) woke up, she felt lightheaded, like she was drugged. She found herself sitting below a window that was illuminated by the moon. As the girl stood up, she noticed that she was standing in a long hallway full of doors. The walls of the hallway were filled with old and creepy portraits. She felt disgusted and frightened by the sight.

Cory (2nd floor) was woken by the sound of intercom ringing.

He was confused, but didn’t answer the intercom right away. While he was rubbing his eyes, he found himself in a medium sized room with full furniture and a mirror that had a strange glow.

Cory was amazed by the mirror, but the constant ringing from the intercom annoyed him, so he answered it. It was Tracy who was frightened and was crying on the line.

Tracy (5th floor) felt a childlike hand waking her up. When she opened her eyes she saw a dwarf covered in blood and holding on a bloody cleaver. She jumped away from him and started screaming. The dwarf tried to calm her down and told her that he doesn’t want to hurt her. But suddenly Tracy saw a hand piercing through his stomach. While he let out his last breath, Tracy heard him whisper “Run…”

While she was running, she quickly entered the first door she stumbled upon. After closing and securing the door with a chair, she saw an intercom, and tried to contact anybody who can help her.

Tracy was amazed to hear a familiar voice. It was Cory’s.""

Ground floor

"" The whole room was lit up by dimmed lanterns and chandeliers.

Old, dusty furniture with giant spider webs could be found here and there in the room. Some of them are partially destroyed. Chairs with missing handles or partially missing backrests were laying on the floor. The colorful carpet that was going up the stairs was either ripped, either from the wooden floor or maybe by something else, and it was burnt in certain places.

At the top of the main stair case was a big painting of a ghoulish-like man in a suit that looked frightened, like it saw something monstrous. Besides that, there were other paintings.

On the right side of the ghoulish-like man was a painting of a black short-haired woman posing on a red French sofa just like your average French girls. She was wearing a light beige night gown that was to her ankles. She had a long neckless with a red piece of jewelry on it. In her hair there were two white lilies on each side that reminded of cat ears. In her left hand she was holding a pink rose. In the back of the sofa was a long crumbled curtain that filled the whole background.

On the left side of the ghoulish-like man was an oil painting of a screaming girl with long black hair. The figure of a girl seemed like it was she was very skinny. Her face was smudged and you couldn’t see her eyes from her bangs and her whole face was a bit deformed. She was standing in some kind of a dark room or space, but there was some luminance coming from the left side of the painting. In the left bottom corner something was written. The sentence that was written was “Nascentes morimur”.

Wallpapers were also ripped, so it must be that something really big and strong came roaming through this Mansion. The wallpaper had a mosaic-like pattern. The walls were also damaged in some places. Also there was fresh blood splattered here and there on the wall. When you look closer in the damaged parts of the wall, you could see the planks that made the wall.

The floor seemed to be partially eaten by termites. There were visible holes in it. The other part of floor seemed like it was made out of ashes.

If you went upstairs, you could see a kind of a balcony that sounded the lower floor. Handrail had missing pieces. If you touched it, you could feel something moving through it. Maybe the stories were true. Maybe the Mansion was alive…

On the left side of the staircase, there was a big gap on the handrail. Did something jumped through it or just threw something at it? If you looked from the point of the gap, there was a shattered chair right in front of it. It looked like something was floating behind the handrail and the chair smashed right into it.

The red shattered carpet continued throughout the higher floor. On each side there were staircases that led up to the rest of the Mansion.

Wallpapers on this floor were different. They were striped with darker and brighter shades of red. The darker shade seemed thicker. If you touched that shade it felt like fresh paint, but it was something different. After rubbing it, you realized it was blood. The blood was dripping through the walls in even parts, making the perfect stripes on the walls...""",Down the Street (Intro)

horror,sub,"Just watched on Netflixs.  It follows the book closely. Like the day of the rocjs with the meters crashing down was cool. The whole exchange where the scene where kid Carrie goes next door to Estelle and asks what her breasts are is comedic gold. Carrie says good girls don't get those. Mommy calls them dirty pillows. Estelle says your mom is such a hypocrite, she's like a cçup. Margret comes out and tells her to get in the house. Estelle says we were just talking. Margaret calls her a whore girl.
Also like how she destroys the town.
Also I feel bad for Carrie. She isn't sissy, but she plays vulnerable well. So when the pigs blood is poured on her I cry. 

Also found the gyms destruction super intense with the music and all the flying objects. Good to see all the bad kids get their just deserts.

horror,sub,"I just finished watching the two sequels to the original Beyond the Door from 1974- neither of which are actually sequels in any way, in true Italian horror tradition. 

There's *Shock* (also released as, of course, *Beyond the Door II*) from 1977, directed by Mario Bava, which follows a family moving into an old house that ends up being haunted by the ghost of the wife/mother's ex-husband, who died in an accident at sea many years prior. He possesses the son of the family &amp; some mildly Oedipal themes emerge. However, things aren't what they seem with the story &amp; several twists are revealed throughout. It's a typical batshit crazy 70's flick that makes very little sense but does feature some enjoyable effects for the time &amp; neat shots. 

Then, there's *Beyond the Door III*, AKA *Amok Train*, released **over a decade** after the last entry into the franchise in 1989. Starring a bunch of actors who went on to do a whole lot of nothing &amp; a few that had pretty lengthy careers, it's an absolute trainwreck (pun intended, sue me) of a movie that I cannot recommend in good faith. It's that bad. The story makes less than no sense, it's all over the place from beginning to end, &amp; the acting is not good. It revolves around an evil train (hence the alternate title) that kills people &amp; stuff, and may or may not be possessed by literal Satan, as well as this demonic cult who are trying to sacrifice/betroth the main heroine to their ""master"" (the devil) because she's a virgin. I don't even know if that's the actual plot or not, because it was hard enough to grasp &amp; I struggled to pay much attention past the halfway point.

Even though they weren't for me, I know these movies have their fans. So, if anybody has their own takes to share, I welcome them.",Anybody seen the entire Beyond the Door trilogy?

horror,sub,"Just made this cause I thought it would be fun / interesting. Not saying all the types i'm about to list off cover everything, but I tend to notice these types of characters a lot in horror based movies and video games. If you were a character in a horror scenario, who would you be?

 

***The “Relatable” Survivor*** 

* Stereotypical every-man / every-woman; An average person from a humble background. 
* Has little-to-no combat or survival skills. Usually relies on practicality and their common sense to evade the monsters / killers and solve problems. 
* Constantly on the edge of a nervous breakdown.
* Seemingly weak and inept, but can accomplish surprisingly impressive feats if backed into a corner. 

***The “Tired” Survivor*** 

* Low-key depressed. Uses dissociation and aloofness as a defense mechanism against things that make them scared or uncomfortable.
* Has cripplingly poor self-esteem, but will try to fight a god out of pure spite. 
* Most likely has some form of past trauma which explains why they’re so emotionally detached; They’ve seen some shit. 
* Reacts to grotesque horror with curiosity or cold indifference. 

***The “Soldier” Survivor*** 

* Has experience with fighting and is capable of defending themselves. 
* Acts like they aren’t bothered by all the crazy shit they’ve witnessed, but are secretly disturbed by it. 
* Usually the first to volunteer to distract the monsters / killers in order to buy time for others to escape. 
* Levels of intelligence can vary, but they’re usually smart enough to know when something isn’t right. 

***The “Innocent” Survivor*** 

* Too good for all of the horrible things they endure. Most likely comes from a very sheltered and comfortable background. 
* Has a mini heart attack every time they hear a scary noise. When it comes to fight or flight, they will almost always choose to run away. 
* Can come off as naive or too trusting of others; Easily manipulated or lured into a trap. 
* If they survive, they will have some serious emotional scarring to deal with and need therapy. 

***The “Investigator” Survivor***

* Usually a detective, journalist, or scientist; They're inquisitive personality makes them natural problem solvers. 
* Can be a bit of a jerk and a smart ass, but they sympathize with those who are most shook-up or victimized by whatever chaotic situation they are in. 
* Prefers to observe monsters / killers from a distance instead of directly engaging them. 
* Isn’t afraid to ask the tough questions. Often clashes with other survivors when things get tense. 

***The “Hermit” Survivor***

* Gives off feral vibes; Didn’t fit into society well even before the horror began. 
* Will beat you up if you look at them the wrong way. While usually not outright malicious, they aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty. 
* A stubborn lone wolf that dislikes working with others. Acts like a bad-ass to mask their insecurities and fears. 
* Determined to accomplish their goal no matter what. Whether it’s simply for survival, revenge, or trying to prove to themselves that they aren’t weak.",Survivor Archetypes in horror scenarios; tag yourself.

horror,sub,"Okay, first off, I'm fully aware that these two examples are so vague that they are almost certainly unintentional, but I thought some of you might find this as weirdly interesting as I do.

The first example comes from a similarity I noticed in the way Drew Barrymore says ""Michael.  Michael Myers.""  When answering a question in the opening of 'Scream'.

(hopefully my timestamp works, if not skip to 1:35)

https://youtu.be/iIidUC2sYUI?t=95

Now compare that to the way Jamie Lloyd says it (also over the phone) in the opening of The Curse Of Michael Myers:

https://youtu.be/57p4GAH6zBw?t=50  (timestamp 00:50)

This is something I noticed a long time ago but always felt weird trying to bring up to other people, because I'm pretty sure it's just a coincidence.


I was also thinking about 'Scream 2' recently and how a scene in that reminded of a scene from Friday The 13th Part 5:  A New Beginning.

When I first saw A New Beginning, I was aware that the killer would be a copycat, not the real Jason, but I had no idea who the killer would be.  Then a random ass paramedic has some lines for no reason and it quickly became clear that he would be the killer.  Why else would they bring attention to him by giving him lines?

It reminded me of the part in Scream 2 where the eventual reveal of the killer being Billy's mother is sort of hinted at by having one of the rabble of journalists seen several times, not only be given plenty of lines, but also be played by Laurie Metcalf, an actress most people would recognise.

That is compounded when Gail refers to the 'reporter' as ""Local Woman"".

It seemed so ham-fisted the first time I saw it, because it clearly hinted that the reporter had a bigger part to play in the movie as a whole.

It becomes less ham-fisted when I started to wonder if it was an intentional reference to A New Beginning, and the way they handled introducing a new killer.

The fact that she turns out to be Billy's mother also seems to subtly reference Friday The 13th, so maybe this was intentional?

Like I said, both probably coincidental, but I had some time to kill, so I thought I'd share.

horror,sub,"So I discovered another schlocktacular movie that I somehow own and I remember watching this once but I only remember the Dad being abducted and turned into a weird dog alien thing and that movie is ***Xtro*** a 1982 British science fiction horror movie directed by [H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Bromley_Davenport)arry Bromley-Davenport. Starring Bernice Stegers, [P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Sayer)hillip Seyer, and [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Nash)imon Nash.

The synopsis of the movie reads Tony’s father Sam, abducted by aliens three years earlier, returns to earth and seeks out his wife and son, but Rachel has since been living with Joe and the reunion is awkward. Joe doesn’t trust Sam, and Rachel can’t quite decide what her feelings are for her two men. Sam is not the same as when he left, and he begins affecting Tony in frightening ways.

Having watched this I think I can safely say this movie is probably the filmic equivalent of marmite, you are either going to love or hate it or be ambivalent and I couldn’t predict what reaction anyone would have. It’s like a fevered nightmare of a dream with gore aplenty and lots and lots of surreal weirdness wrapped in a very British TV family drama about divorce...yeah it’s weird but at the same time makes total sense.

 In effect the whole story was really about a Dad's love for his family and him wanting to return to take them back to his new alien homeworld and here’s the other thing all of that seemingly unconnected weirdness I just described has an in film setup, build up and pay off if you are paying close enough attention to what is happening in every scene. Which is what makes Xtro stand out amongst most B-movies, most B-movies set things up then never pay them off, or just have pay offs come out of thin air and long stretches of boring exposition.

And that’s one thing you could never accuse Xtro of being, boring, something is always happening on screen and the use of lighting, practical effects and clever camera angles make what could have been a dull b-movie into something that is worth a watch I think.

But as I said before you might be one of the people who just find this far, far too weird to ever make any kind of sense and hate it. Either is an option to be honest.

Why didnt they escape into the underground ""cathedral"" that was shown in the end of 1000 immediately after waking up to the cops?  Was it pride on the characters part? Did they just not have the sets anymore? I know they used different houses for each movie. 

What about Otis? He just changed hair color and skin tone over night?

I think it’s clear that older Joo-Hee aka Hyun-Jin had developed a mental illness bc of the mistreatment and abuse by her parents and everyone else.

However, I have soooooo many questions... there’s a scene when young Joo-Hee asks Hyun-Jin (older Joo-Hee) at the soccer field, “do you really think my mom is sending me to the dentist to get my teeth fixed?” Was her mom human trafficking &amp; pimping Joo-Hee for sex in exchange for money? There was also a rape scene between Joo-Hee &amp; the mentally disabled son of the grocery store owner. Does she go back to sleep with him for money/free items?

horror,sub,"First time poster here!

I have been on a bit of a horror bender lately. After an underwhelming viewing of the Exorcist (tv series) on Netflix I was looking for something with more scare.

The series is in French, at first I had the English dubs on but it was really distracting. I understand some french so switching to subs was way better.

The premise is a writer whose dreams are haunted by a witch, unless she writes about said witch. The series begins with her vowing to change directions and write about something else. Basically the whole series is switching between very quirky humour and thrilling, occasionally gory horror, which is a setup I really love.

horror,sub,"Tryna do this in some kind of chronological order. I'll review each franchise in list form in a post in this thread.

*Psycho*: Consistently good, except for the fourth, which I've never seen. 8/10

The *Living Dead* franchise (Romero): The first three are great, and *Land* is underrated. Everything after *Land* is dire - it's like Romero forgot how to direct horror. 6/10

*The Exorcist*: The third is better than the stellar original, and even the (admittedly bad) second film has a lot of interesting ideas that just don't gel into a concrete whole. 8/10

*The Texas Chainsaw Massacre*: The first four films are all very different, and I like them all, *even that crazy piece of shit fourth one* with it's weird Illuminati subplot. The remake and the prequel are the definition of bland. '13 is interesting, but also pretty bad. I haven't seen the newest film. 7/10

*Halloween*: I actually think it's consistently great, with the exception of the fifth movie, straight to *Resurrection*, at which point it falls right into the gutter and doesn't recover until *Halloween* 2018. 7/10

*Phantasm*: Probably the greatest horror franchise, in terms of quality. All five films are great, including the slow as shit and plotless but supremely atmospheric *OblIVion*. All five films have different tones, and yet they all feel organically connected. My favorite. 9/10

*Froday the 13th*: Fun and dumb all the way through. I think the third one is bland, and *Manhattan* is incoherent, but I'd never turn down a chance to watch any of them. 8/10

*A Nightmare On Elm Street*: The first three are all great, and then it becomes almost unwatchable until *New Nightmare*. *Dream Child* has interesting ideas but gets too bogged down with effects wizardry to fully execute them properly. 6/10

*Child's Play*: I used to hate this franchise with a passion. Then I grew up and learned that humor is good in a horror franchise. *Seed* is still an abysmal piece of shit, though. 7/10",My opinion on what I consider the major modern horror franchises

Relic is a harrowing, emotional and heartbreaking depiction of grief, loss, dementia and how it affects not just the person, but their family as well. Though some people might find it slow burn, but for me, I think the movie moved at an accurate pace,giving us enough time to empathize with the characters and their suffering. It doesn't go much to the backstory and that decision didn't really have any negative impact on the film.

Set on a Florida college campus circa the late 80's, *Primal Rage* follows an aspiring journalist, his best friend (also a journalist), and a couple of classmates they're pining after as they become the unfortunate victims of a virus that turns people into rabid killers. 

A cheap Italian effort shot in the US, I didn't have especially high expectations for it, but figured I'd wind up watching it someday anyway. After it sat on my list for a few months, I finally got around to checking it out- &amp; this thing blew me away. It's not the best movie ever, no, but all things considered I'm not sure how this doesn't have more of a cult following. It's got everything you could want in cheesy 80's horror- a fun soundtrack, likeable characters, solid acting, good practical effects, and an interesting plot. All it's missing is nudity, but if that's a dealbreaker for you (and I don't know anybody for whom it would be) I don't know what to say.

The story is pretty basic, but it's engaging &amp; nicely paced- it also benefits a lot from the college campus setting. The characters are sympathetic &amp; feel pretty human, which makes seeing some of them face slow &amp; agonizing demise a bit sad. There is this gang of frat assholes who are *incredibly* cartoony and over the top, but they don't ruin the whole movie. A few plot details don't quite add up, but it's easy enough to ignore them. There are sprinkles of comedy here &amp; there, some of which don't stick the landing, but I laughed at most of them. There's also a *really* neat Halloween party sequence that features some of the coolest costumes I have ever seen in a movie, as well as a few creative kills to up the body count. Seriously, I want to own some of those masks. 

There's definitely a bit of a ""Made for TV"" vibe to this one, which I'm sure will turn some away from it. There's implied nude scenes that I'm honestly not sure why they aren't more explicit, not that it was necessary- it just struck me as odd that, for a low-budget late-80's Italian horror flick set at a college there's zero nudity unless it's paired with graphic gore. Speaking of, most of the really bloody stuff is spaced out, &amp; in between we get cutaways or minimal- if any- blood at all.

The slow-burn episodes set a perfect mood at the beginning, only to pull the rug under our feet with the mystery coming into play. It keeps you on the edge till the end.

On the flip side, the characters and their relations are a bit hard to figure out at first as the story takes place in two timelines. Sometimes even had to do a little back and forth to remember all those details in the first one or two episodes. But it all becomes clear gradually as the story unravels.

horror,sub,,Official Scrutinized Trailer - Reflect Studios
horror,sub,"Released in 1974 and also commonly known as *Let Sleeping Corpses Lie* (which is the title it's listed under pretty much everywhere) this is a zombie movie following two unlikely companions who, on an otherwise innocent roadtrip together throughout the English countryside, wind up becoming involved in the beginnings of an undead apocalypse. 

Is this quite possibly a Night of the Living Dead ripoff? Yes. Absolutely. Is it good anyway? Yep. Is it different enough from NotLD to stand on its own? I believe it is. A strange combination of an environmental PSA, Italian sleaze, &amp; classic zombie films, *Manchester Morgue* is a pretty good time if you're a fan of the zombie genre that offers a lot of gore to stare at and a really unique idea at its core that's arguably still relevant. 

This time around, it isn't a virus or anything that's causing the undead to rise out of their graves &amp; eat other people- instead, it's a strange machine that uses ultrasonic radiation to kill insects by getting them to attack each other &amp; essentially self-exterminate. Unfortunately, the radiation just so happens to have the side effect of bringing dead people back to life. What's more interesting is that these zombies aren't just eating folks to sustain their own lives, but also to use human blood as a means of reviving other corpses &amp; building an army. Smart cookies, these ones.

Beyond just the unique setup, there are a lot of other pluses to this. The atmosphere is very effective &amp; the settings are pretty neat. Hospitals, barren country roads, a cemetery- nothing new, of course, but still fun. Unfortunately, there's also some negatives, &amp; the biggest one is the characters. Nobody is particularly likeable, &amp; in fact the main hero George is portrayed as a total self-righteous douchebag throughout most of the thing. His companion on the journey, Edna, is the most sympathetic of anybody, but she doesn't really get to do much. Then there's the ending, which I wasn't especially fond of, but I'm sure it'll have its fans. 

Overall, this is a very weird entry into zombie horror, and while it's got some nice ideas &amp; impressive gore going for it, it doesn't always stick the landing in terms of story or character &amp; that definitely makes a difference. Things like the aforementioned human blood thing never really get expanded on &amp; seem to exist just for the sake of being different, &amp; there are some weird skips in the plot. Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit &amp; I think that fans of the genre will appreciate what it has to offer even if it doesn't become an all-time favorite.",The Living Dead At Manchester Morgue - Environmentally Conscious Horror

It starts off like a psychological thriller with few characters acting weirdly while having dinner and you can feel the threat in the air, but the movie doesn't explain anything. I am not 100% sure the message was about ocean pollution, but it seemed to point toward it at the very least, mixed with other sub-genres and slightly resembling The Fog and the recent Color Out of Space.

horror,sub,"My quick review:

Michael Dougherty hasn't done much, but Trick R' Treat is definitely a great horror film - a blast from beginning to end. And like his first film, Krampus, is a kick-ass midnight flick that's gory, funny, and scary, all at the same time. A modern B-movie that what lacks in pace makes up in spirit and features an excellent twist in the home-invasion genre.

It captured the spirit of Christmas in a unique way, poking at so many stereotypes in its first half alone. The intro is a fantastic satire to capitalism in modern America; how during the holidays people transform into relentless shopping beasts that will stop at nothing, even snatching gifts from people's hands to ultimately gift to somebody else - a powerful irony that counters the true spirit of Christmas.

Some truly fun characters as well, David Koechner (Howard) and Conchata Ferrel (Aunt Dorothy) stole the comedy spotlight, Emjay Anthony (Max) was the true heavy weight who served as the backbone of the film, and Scott and Colette were great as usual.

Now, I can see how this film is not for everyone and why it slightly polarized critics. It never goes too far on the comedy or horror end. I wish it would've cranked it up to 11, but I guess Dougherty was constrained to the PG-13 rating and couldn't really take this to an insane level. I don't think its intention was to appeal to a wide audience due to the obscure subject matter and visually challenging antagonists. I can perfectly see how some parents might hate it or love it. Either way, I know in the past few years it's found a niche audience and over time it might even develop somewhat of a cult following.

Definitely worth the watch, and more so if you're in the mood for a different style and sub-genre of horror that's weirdly entertaining from beginning to end.","After lingering on watching Krampus and then seeing the amount of people on this sub that always recommend it, I finally got around it tonight and God damn that was fun!"

A crazy storm rolled in 30 mins before Bruce was supposed to go on stage/screen, but thankfully Bruce waited it out and got up there only 25 mins after originally scheduled. The insane storm left for the night, but sadly after the second movie, The Beyond, they had to cancel the rest of the event because someone ripped the vintage sink off the wall of the men’s room. They had to turn off the water supply and couldn’t legally be open without restrooms. Bruce teased people who asked questions, as per his routine, but my worry is one of the awkward kids took it too hard and decided “to get revenge” or something similarly stupid.

horror,sub,"I feel like this is an over asked question here, but I couldn’t find any answers. 

Horror movies have always fascinated me. The “scary” episodes of shows growing up always fascinated me, and I’ve watched scary movies more and more as time has gone on, but there’s a small part of me that’s still averse to them? It’s odd. I enjoy them, but am genuinely scared by virtually every single one that I’ve seen. I was scared to use the public bathroom in my dorm after watching the shining, the original Friday the 13th made me sleep with the lights on, and even though I throughly enjoyed the Wicker Man and thought it was awesome, I had to switch on all of the lights as I walked to bed (I’m a 21 year old). 

Most people who seem to enjoy horror movies don’t seem phased by them. Were they always like that, taking to them like a duck to water? Or did they start off like me as sort of scaredy cats before building up a “tolerance” so to speak.

horror,sub,"The slasher genre is a very interesting type of subgenre for horror, as well as possibly the most popular. While it could be argued if these slasher movies are actually scary or not, one thing’s for certain is that they can be very entertaining. Especially if you watch to see the creative kills and seeing the horror movie villain in action. Here is my top ten list of my favourite slasher movies! I will be mentioning sequels in my list as some sequels I’ve enjoyed more than the first movie. However, my rule is simply to name one movie per franchise (If it is from a franchise). Without further ado, onto the list! 

**My Top 10 Favourite Slasher Movies:**

10.) **Saw II (2005)** – I will admit that I’ve never been much of a fan of the Saw franchise. The first two movies were the only movies I genuinely liked. Of the two, however, I would have to say that the sequel is way better. It’s takes everything that was great about the first film and made everything better in the sequel, while expanding more on the setup within this world. We get to see a lot more of John Kramer, who became one of my favourite horror movie villains because of this movie, and he absolutely steals the show. In this movie, we get to follow a much larger cast of characters, giving us more victims to use for a lot more death traps. Here, the death traps are a lot more fun and creative. Unfortunately, a few characters suffer from stupidity like that chick who thought it would be smart to put both her hands in a saw box. However, I really loved the twist in the end. 

9.) **Happy Death Day (2017)** – Just when I was getting tired of the slasher genre, this movie came in and surprised me is so many ways! It’s basically the horror version of Groundhog Day. Our main character, Tree, is very likable and on her birthday, she’s always being murdered by a slasher known as the Babyface Killer. It’s a really fun movie with many creative kills. Tree also gets a great case of character development as the films go on. The sequel is nearly just as good. Too bad I had to choose between the two of them but I guess the first one ultimately came out on top due to it getting me back into the slasher genre. I really hope Happy Death Day 3 eventually comes because I really love this concept! 

8.) **Halloween (1978)** – I’m probably going to get a lot of hate for putting Halloween a little low on my list. Make no mistake, I really love this movie! It easily has the best theme song out of EVERY horror movie! Michael Myers is also one of the greatest horror movie villains of all time, being a silent psychopath and the embodiment of pure evil. My only problem is that it IS a little slow in some parts. Still, it’s a very believable horror movie as Laurie has no idea why Michael wants to kill her so much, and we the audience don’t even know why, making him so much more terrifying. It takes Loomis to shoot Michael SIX times to knock him out for a short while, only for him to escape. I will say this, while I love the  1981 and 2018 sequels, they just don’t compare to this movie. It’s iconic for a damn good reason. 

7.) **The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)** – This is one of those rare cases where I prefer the remake over the original. I know the original is preferred by many as it IS a classic, but I just feel like this movie is a little better. Leatherface is not only a lot more scarier here, but he’s also a lot more badass. Also, his entire family (Save for a small boy) are all sadistic cannibals. Here, they’re not called the Sawyers but the Hewitts. Sheriff Charlie Hewitt is a LOT more sadistic and monstrous compared to Drayton. Charlie takes absolute pleasure in torturing and mindbreaking his victims, before slaughtering them eventually. While most of the characters are a little stale, this is truly one of the best remakes I’ve ever watched and one of the reasons why Leatherface is one of my favourite horror movie villains of all time. 

6.) **Scream (1996)** – This movie is such a fun ride. Right at the beginning, it instantly got me hooked. This movie has a great cast of characters, and I love the whole horror mystery plot for this movie, giving us a whole who-done-it type of story like who is the Ghostface Killer. I won’t lie. I mainly got into this movie through the parody film, Scary Movie, which is was a spoof of this and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Still, I’m glad I eventually got to see this gem. Overall, it’s such a great slasher film that manages to deconstruct every slasher trope and I really loved all the horror movie references in this movie. 

5.) **Child’s Play 2 (1990)** – Dolls are definitely a creepy concept. There’s something about an inanimate object coming to life that’s genuinely unsettling. This is what makes the Child’s Play series one of my favourite franchises of all time. It was a tough decision between the first movie and the sequel but ultimately, Child’s Play 2 came out on top. This movie took everything that was great about the first film and made everything better. Instead of having to go through the build-up again, we get to see Chucky in the beginning get right into action. Chucky is at his absolute best here. Here, he’s still quippy but just serious enough to prove he’s a horror movie villain for a damn good reason. The kills are all great and memorable, and that climax always has my heart racing. Andy is still adorable like how he was from the first movie and the colors are all much more expressive. Overall, this is easily the best Child’s Play film ever made!

4.) **A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)** – This movie took our fears to our comfort zones. Sleeping and dreaming. Just the idea of having our nightmares becoming real and killing us in our sleeps is more than enough to keep us awake for a long time. Freddy Krueger is also one of the most influential horror movie villains of all time, being one of the first villains with a full personality. His theme song is really chilling, with the chorus of children, and just the whole damn setting is terrifying. Freddy’s kills are really some of the best, with the most memorable death being the Johnny Depp dragged into the bed death! Nancy is also my favourite final girl. There’s also a lot of great lore and backstory for Freddy. He was original a child serial killer and because he got out of prison, the parents of the children burnt him alive. Now he is back to prove that not even death can save their children from Freddy Krueger. Definitely not only one of the best slasher movies, but one of the best horror movies of all time!

3.) **Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (1984)** – Without a doubt the best Friday the 13th movie! This is the movie which made Jason Voorhees become my favourite horror movie villain ever. Here, he is at his best and he has so many great kills. Along with that, this is also the one Friday film that has the most likable cast in the franchise. Who could forget Jimmy’s crazy dance to woo one of the twins! Tommy Jarvis is also the most likable child protagonist in the series, who is also mostly popular due to being one of the very few people to actually defeat Jason Voorhees. Jason’s death in this movie is so gruesome and yet so satisfying. Overall, this movie has definitely earned its place in my top ten list. 

2.) **Final Destination 2 (2003)** – I really love the Final Destination franchise. It’s yet another interesting concept for the slasher genre. Instead of having a typical killer slaughtering the main characters, it’s objects that do all the slashing! My favourite of the entire franchise, though, is Final Destination 2. Like with many other sequels I’ve mentioned on this list, this movie takes everything that was great about the first film and makes the sequel so much better. It expands more on the lore of this universe, who Death is and the deaths are a lot more graphic and well done. The best part is that EVERYTHING is done using practical effects. Where the later movies would eventually come to rely on CGI, this movie perfectly has that personality by going full on practical, and boy does it look amazing! The road accident scene is still the best premonition scene in this whole franchise as every death is done so well. I also loved how we get one of the cast from the previous movie returning, and this movie is the ONLY movie to have the main characters survive Death. My only complaint is that Alex, the main protagonist from the first movie, dies offscreen by a brick of all things. Still, with many great performances, good characters and such a well-made film, this movie truly stands out as one of the best horror movies I’ve ever watched. Tony Todd as the creepy William Bludworth is also always great to see in these movies as well.

1.) **The Cabin in the Woods (2012)** – This is a very unique choice for this list. It’s not just a slasher film. In fact, it’s basically a mix of nearly every genre. It’s got slasher in it, supernatural, cosmic horror, horror comedy and pretty much everything else to do with horror. That’s why this is not only my number one favourite slasher film, but my favourite horror movie of all time. It basically deconstructs every horror trope in the book. Even using the typical teen stereotypes we’re so used to seeing as a plot point. My favourite part is the final act, where we see basically every horror monster imaginable. We especially get to see nearly every one of them go beserk on the facility. The best part? This movie used practical effects for nearly everything, making this movie all the more special. So yeah, I could go on and on about why this is my favourite horror movie but then I’d just be writing a full essay. As a whole, this movie is a ton of fun! It’s got a LOT of great kills and a very unique concept, by using horror movie tropes to kill the victims.

horror,sub,"Hey everyone!

We all know our favorite “slasher” franchises has a dud with no exceptions. Halloween has Resurrection, Texas Chainsaw 3D, F13 has Jason Takes Manhattan or Jason X, and Hellraiser eventually went straight to video just to name a few.

My favorite series has always been Elm Street with the idea of dying in your sleep is truly terrifying. In most films, when someone falls asleep we know they made it and are safe until the next day. I feels that’s what made Elm Street unique since falling asleep is inevitable. 

However as the series went on, Freddy became more cartoonish than the demon of our nightmares we was introduced to in ANOES 1. Beginning with Dream Warriors which is my favorite Elm Street movie, Freddy started with one liners which brought him a following where the audience wanted to see Freddy and what he would bring in the next film.

I am a firm believer that Dream Child is the worst of the series as it being boring, but having really cool dream sequences (Dans death has stuck with me for some time!)

But I’m here to talk about what we got with the Final Nightmare and what could’ve/should’ve been. Luckily I was only 9 months old in September of 1991 when the final nightmare came out because I would’ve been disappointed in what we got. I’m not saying it’s a horrible film, but it isn’t what we deserved or what Englund deserved as a potential send off to this iconic movie monster!

With The Final Nightmare it is set 10 years in the future which would be 2001. Alice and Jacob moves away (I’ll get back to my opinion on this) and all kids are gone with the exception of 1, John Doe. Freddy being out of new souls needs John to lure unknowing teenagers to Springwood so he can get them in their dreams. Freddys sends John past Elm Street via bus and he hits his head and has amnesia. (This John Doe was born! Don’t get excited because he brings nothing to the table character wise) He is taken to a Teen center for troubled youth by cops where he is taken in an consoled by Dr. Maggie Burroughs who is one of the few bright spots for my tastes. She finds a newspaper clipping and decides to take him to Springwood to see if it will help spark his mind to remember. 3 troubled teens stow away in the back of the van which will not be the trip of their dreams (I’m not Freddy so bad pun :/)Turns out, Freddy has a kid! In a nutshell John begins to think he is Freddy’s kid and that’s why he is still alive. Flash forward past Carlos’ death from enhanced hearing (cool death), Spencer’s death via power glove, and figuring out more details on Tracy’s past as she was sexually abused by her father (she kicks Freddy’s ass). John then is attacked in his dream where Freddy’s reveals his child is a girl. He tells this to Maggie as he dies. Maggie finds her adoption papers learning she is Freddy’s daughter. Enter the dream demons, which a man called Doc who works at the center figures out is the source of Kruegers power and if pulled into the real world he can be stopped (hasn’t been tried for a few sequels so worth another shot) Maggie volunteers to go into the dream world but is given 3D glasses to enter his mind and to let the audience know the put them on for terrible 90s 3D effects. In the end Freddy is pulled back into the dream world after we learn he was an abused boy who was made fun of. The final confrontation pits daughter against father where Freddy is blew up by a piper bomb where Maggie leaves him with a “happy Father’s Day!” But they had to give Freddy the last word with “Kids🤷🏻‍♂️” the dream demons leave Freddy seemingly for good and we get a NOES montage.

Sheesh what an odd movie. For one it isn’t horror and they made some really bold decisions.

Why in the world would Alice and Jacob leave, they were supposed to destroy the Sith not join them...wrong movie but you catch my drift. They know how to stop Freddy and could’ve prevented this kid less version of Springwood. So why make them leave? Rachel Talalay was given so much lead-way with the script as she wrote and directed this film. It’s not bad as I have said before, just not what was deserved.

Do you prefer the idea of the dream police? Where Jacob must save Alice and Elm Street from being destroyed by Krueger. This would’ve seen the return of Joey, Kincaid and Taryn as the dream police who are summoned whenever Krueger shows up. (NGL sounds cool from the script) however making this work and turning the series back into horror was not in this potential sequel but for me I prefer this idea over Freddy’s dead.

Then Peter Jackson wrote a script where people wanted to go to sleep to pick on Freddy as he had lost his power. Long story short, some kid fucks up and Freddy gets his power back.

What do you think of Freddys dead?
What did you like? ....hate?
Would you have preferred Dream Police?

horror,sub,,It Chapter Two Cinematography
horror,sub,"Really good and original movie, I was very surprised. You almost want to live the way do when watching it, Tilda made a good point at the end about how horrible real life is and all.

I understand the main point and that they keep living in their fantasy world, then Petula leaves, forgets and comes back again. This goes on for the rest of their lives apparently (even the suicide was a fantasy). Since so much of the events was a fantasy, there are few things I am not clear about:

1. Tilda's role - the whole movie she seems to be on Petula's side and like the one who gets the most abuse in her kid role. But at the end she seems almost like the most domineering one and in on it with Daphne. So during the times when Petula leaves the house, does she leave with her and play along until they come back? 

2. The cops and drugs are all fake, but Petula (and maybe Tilda) did live outside the house off and on?

3. The scene with the old guy who calls Petula a witch is real? We can see a play train and the movie hints that the train ride never even happened. But we also know that Petula leaves the house regularly

4. The cop isn't killed. But what about Daphne's grandparents, they probably did have to kill them. 

5. Why is that fall incident even that important in the later context (it was when it seemed that Daphne was the crazy one)

6. I don't think anyone can answer this, but logistically how do they even live if the house is in reality not in a good condition. Who even goes to get food and shit?  I guess Daphne has money.

7. The suicide is obviously fake since we see them go on until they're old (and ok there are hints that maybe even the way we see them in a movie is their fantasy of themselves when they were kids or when they are old)


The only criticism I have towards the movie is that it gives some backstory that seems kind of irrelevant (that fall) but it doesn't explain what really made them so crazy and where everyone's parents are.

I've only found references to the Xenomorph's inspirations from H.R. Giger's  *Necronom IV* . I heard someone claim recently that Giger's design for the Xenomorph's iconic second inner jaw was partially inspired from pharyngeal jaws found in nature (Ex- Moray eel).

&amp;#x200B;

I also read about the sexual aspects of the inner jaw (both in context of forcibly penetrating victims' faces and the retractable teeth's connection to vagina dentata), but is there any documented evidence of Giger citing eels or fish as an influence on his design? If so, this would make a lot of sense in retrospect, given how the Xenomorph's head always reminded me of an eel even as a kid.

horror,sub,"  

**The Burning (1981)** This has everything you would want in a classic 80s slasher: Summer Camp setting, shower scene, prank gone wrong and revenge, actors that became famous later in life (Jason Alexander, Holly Hunter) and possibly the single greatest action-gore scene of them all, courtesy of Tom Savini. One of the best of the genre, not to be missed.

**Def by Temptation (1990)** A sexy succubus is murdering NYC bar patrons. The son of a preacher must resist. Jeez, this was just awful.  A succubus movie with no nudity.  James Bond III was a child star in the 80s but he grew up to write, direct and star in this and doesn’t have another film credit for 20 years! Also with Kadeem Hardison and Samuel L Jackson. 

**Lake Bodom (2016)** Finnish slasher starts out fine, 2 pairs of teens visit a camp site that had a massacre 40 years earlier, but around the time of the first “twist” about half waythrough, the characters motivations were so weak it practically knocked my brain out of the rest of the movie. I mean it wasn’t bad or anything and I suppose if you don’t think too hard. It’s a horror movie after all. Subtitles. 

**Piranha (1978)** Heather Menzies (Ssssss) is a private investigator looking for two missing teens. She and the mountain drunkard, Bradford Dilman (Bug), end up at a military testing facility where they unknowingly empty a pool of genetically altered piranha into a Texas river, where they eventually prey on a kids summer camp, and the grand opening of a family resort. Joe Dante’s 2nd feature film for Roger Corman, he was just getting started. Loaded with familiar genre faces, Kevin McCarthy, Keenan Wynn, Dick Miller, Barbara Steele, Paul Bartel, and Belinda Balaski. A personal alltime fave.  
   
**Humanoids From the Deep (1980)** My favorite 80s eco-horror. A cannery is set to open up in a Pacific Northwest fishing town, prompting a feud between local Native Americans and white fisherman. Scientists have been feeding growth hormones to the salmon, causing some of the more primitive fish to rapidly evolve into slimy fish people with an urge to reproduce! Gory, good nudity, lots of explosions, fish fucking, and a ventriloquist dummy who nearly gets laid in a tent. Doug McClure plays the hero, Vic Morrow the villain. Rob Bottin (The Thing, The Howling) created the humanoids and produced by Roger Corman's New World Pictures.

**The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover (1977)** I’ve always been curios about this one from Larry Cohen and TCM played it a few weeks ago. It plays like a documentary of the 50 year FBI head (Broderick Crawford), from his rise to prominence battling mob bosses, then his feud with Bobby Kennedy (Michael Parks) and his obsession with illegal wire taps. The sleazy bits were accusations of homosexuality, and the implication that he got drunk in his office and jerked off to sexually explicit audio tapes! The cast of dozens also included Rip Torn, John Marley and Jose Ferrer. Not very good.

**Chanel Zero season 2: No-End House**. I’d previously seen seasons 3 and 1, and just like those, it started out interesting but I was watching the clock by eps 5 &amp; 6. If you want to hear the lead character's name, Margot, shouted 50x per episode, this is for you.

horror,sub,"Spoiler alert if you haven't seen the whole thing.

So Jack is Cain....or Cayenne as he sais it himself. He got punished by god, whom he refers to as a ""she"" implying that God is female in this

The goateed man at the end cannot be God then. So who is he? Death?

I think it might be the Devil, who came to either collect Steven Ogg's character's soul or have a deal with him. If it was Dearh, he wouldn't have cared if Jack killed him since he would claim him anyway. 

As for what Jack/Cain is?

Well, I beleive he is a vampire, but not in the classical sense. 

In many media, such as in the Blade movies (I think), the Vampire: The Masquerade franchise and others, Cain is mentionned as ""The first Vampire""

Well, Jack said himself that ""he is the one"" implying he is the first and only one. He eats human flesh and drinks human blood, but it doesn't seem to be for sustenance as he eats other stuff. He only started again in the movie when he got hurt. Eating flesh and drinking blood only seemed to help him heal. 

""But what about the stuff he got from the nurse guy?"" You ask?

Well, he never stopped drinking blood. He just got it from a safe source, to not kill anyone. He is sick of killing people.

Basically, his curse is to roam the Earth for eternity while having a hunger for human flesh. Not for sustenance, as he cannot die, but just for added suffering. He never liked killing people, but did anyway to satiate his hunger.

What did you guys think about that movie?","Just watched ""He Never Died"" and I got a theory of my own about the whole thing"
horror,sub,"I know this isn't ""unpopular"" on this sub so I ain't looking for cheap upvotes, but I'm legitimately super amped for Scream 5.  With Dewey and most likely Neve on board (and I'm *Sure* Court will join in last minute, possibly Kirby too), I'm genuinely so excited for the franchise to kick up again. 

It's been TEN YEARS since Scream 4, which I honestly think was ahead of its time even then, and even though some people have sequel fatigue, ten years of new horror content and the way society has shifted brings SO MUCH POTENTIAL for Scream 5. 

I mean even in Scream 4 the addition of modern (at that point) cell phones was new, but with an even more intense social media boom in the last 10 years, they have so much to work with, along with all the new franchises and prestige horror over recent years, including mainstream franchises like Conjuring, Annabelle, etc.

horror,sub,"And holy cow, I'm really impressed. I highly recommend it for anything who's itching for something new. I'd heard good things so I decided to stay up, wait for it to drop, and watch it. Groundbreaking? No. Masterpiece? No. But jesus, it's just riddled with dread and haunting atmosphere. I think some people are going to want to compare it to Hereditary since it deals with family and mental illness and whatnot, but it's very different and isn't trying to copy it. Not that much could get close to Hereditary in my book. 

However, it's slow and isn't trying to make you cower in fear. It's more akin to Oculus. Eerie, unnerving, haunting, etc. As well, don't expect it to answer everything for you. It's one of those movies where the ""evil"" is more a representation of something than a physical entity. Like I said, nothing new but it really worked for me. The last 5 or so minutes, my jaw was wide open. I've needed some horror in my life in lockdown and that really hit the spot.

Also I feel like I remember this scene also being split by someone being killed? But the memories really vague. 

I very easily could have mix and matched movies but i think they went to a conservative vacation spot or the main horror group got lost and were killed by the “crazy Christian cult” type movie and I think the acting was also really bad.

horror,sub,"Overall, I didn’t care for Ouija: Origin of Evil very much; however, it *masterfully* handled one tactic of horror movies I rarely see used.

Several scenes of the movie, even in the daytime scenes meant to relax the tension, you’ll see figures or other creepy images in the background that the movie never draws attention to. If you see it, it creeps you out big time because you realize after 40 seconds of staring at the same scenery, that something was there the whole time. You can also miss it altogether. It makes you search the background of every scene and adds a sense of paranoia for the viewer.

I remember in Annabelle: Origin there was a scene where the demon’s eyes were (barely) visible between some stairs.

horror,sub,"**The Guest** - Man uses absurdly sexy accent to charm his way into a new family, then uses assorted weaponry to violence his way into the heads and ribcages of half the damn town.

Fairly standard slasher flick propped up by an excellent performance from it's leading man and some very clever plays on a few common tropes. 8/10

**The Void** - Policeman finds blood soaked fiend -- like, dope fiend, not evil fiend...an important distinction in this movie -- takes him to the worst run hospital in the universe, and everyone proceeds to die or go insane from a bunch of lovecraftian blurred pixels.

Yeah, the free youtube version is censored in some really dumb ways. Not as distracting as you'd think though since the practical effects and acting were both excellent. Shout out to the annoying nursing student: when she needed to look scared she looked absolutely *terrified*. Practical effects need that, you know? Good actors gotta sell the effects or the effects might come off as cheesy. Otherwise, whole movie just oozes Lovecraft right down to the ending. 9/10.

**Baskin** - A bunch of caricatures of police officers stumble their way into a cannibalistic Slaaneshi sex cult lead by an actual real life caricature. I'm still not convinced any of it was real at all, like it's just the fever dream of someone in a k-hole that's been spending too much time on liveleak. Oh, and there's a fucking music video in the middle of it, not even joking.

Look, when this movie wanted to be fucked up, it was *fucked up*. But even at it's most bone-chilling, the movie wasn't much more than a bunch of nonsense all jam packed together. Which is fine, I dig nonsense, but the last half an hour is nothing but torture porn flashbacks and monologue's. Not terrible, just disjointed as fuck which made the finale surprisingly boring. 4/10","Just watched ""The Guest"", ""The Void"", and ""Baskin"". My thoughts."

As someone who grew up in the hardcore punk/metal scene I’ve never witnessed such a good and real depiction of the culture.

The acting is top notch. It feels so real. The gore effects. Yeah Patrick Stewart in a very different role is a treat. It also feels timely due to the prevalence of white supremacists.

horror,sub,"Personally, I'm a huge fan of both. I'll almost always be happy to spend a weekend on the couch just chilling with something spooky on the tv.

I think they both have a lot to offer when it comes to storytelling and creating atmosphere. There are some truly great scary things you can see or hear in either medium.

But of the two, I find video games to be much scarier because in order to experience the horror and progress you have to become an active participant, whereas watching a movie is more passive in nature. I also think that it's much easier to immerse yourself in the horror atmosphere when you have the option to look around and explore the setting a bit on your own, rather than following a camera guided by someone else and just being along for the ride. Further, having control over where you go and what you look at and what you do comes with the added demand of keeping yourself alive within the game, which I feel adds a layer to the horror; any options you may have for comfort during a movie (like looking away, hiding behind something/one, etc) may not be available to you while playing. This also means that what you do can have consequences for the player character or other characters, while characters in movies continue to play their role regardless of what you might be doing.
